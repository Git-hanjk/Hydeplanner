The World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) develops transformative benchmarks that\nassess companies\u2019 impacts and efforts and ranks them on their contributions to the SDGs. WBA\nbenchmarks focus on the world\u2019s 2,000 most influential companies with the greatest potential to\npositively and negatively impact the systems in which they operate.\nThe aim of this report is threefold. First, it illustrates why these 2,000 influential companies \u2013 the\nSDG2000 \u2013 are critical for achieving the SDGs. Second, it demonstrates the breadth of the SDG2000\nand their impact on people and the planet. Highlighting the substantial footprints of these companies\nprovides essential context for WBA benchmarks and focuses attention on corporate accountability for\naccelerating sustainable development. This is particularly timely given the recent adoption of the", "accelerating sustainable development. This is particularly timely given the recent adoption of the\nUnited Nation's Pact for the Future calling on \u2018the private sector, especially large corporations, to\ncontribute to sustainability and protecting our planet and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and\nthe Sustainable Development Goals.\u20191\nThird, the report addresses challenges companies face in understanding and quantifying their\ncontributions to the SDGs.2 Numerous examples are provided about what the SDGs are, which\nindustries impact specific SDGs and how companies incorporate the SDGs in their sustainability\nreporting.\nSystem transformations are essential for achieving the SDGs. The second chapter of the report\nintroduces WBA\u2019s seven system transformations and why these are critical.

These highlighted areas showcase the\ndiverse impact of the SDG2000 companies, illustrating their footprint and influence on people, the\nplanet and policy, and on achieving the SDGs.\nThe final chapter concludes the report by outlining the ways forward to deepen knowledge around\nthe scope of the SDG2000 and its economic, environmental, and social impact on sustainable\ndevelopment.\nShaping tomorrow: The world's 2,000 most influential companies for the SDGs 3", "development.\nShaping tomorrow: The world's 2,000 most influential companies for the SDGs 3\n2 The SDG2000\n2.1 How the SDG2000 are selected\nWBA has identified seven system transformations necessary to put our society, economy and planet\non a more sustainable path and ultimately achieve the SDGs (Figure 2.1).3 These transformations are\nbased on extensive research as well as detailed feedback from stakeholders.4,5\nFIGURE 2.1: WBA'S SEVEN SYSTEM TRANSFORMATIONS\nBetween July 2019 and January 2020, WBA began\nidentifying companies that could act as catalysts for\nchange and whose actions are vital for wider,\nsystemic transformation. This list of the world\u2019s most\ninfluential companies that play a key role in\nachieving the SDGs \u2013 referred to as the SDG2000 \u2013\nwas first published in January 2020 and is updated\nannually.6 Changes to the list reflect revised\nmethodologies, refined benchmark scopes, updates\nin keystone metrics, such as revenue, and corporate", "in keystone metrics, such as revenue, and corporate\nrestructuring (e.g. mergers, acquisitions and\nbankruptcies).\n2.1.1 From transformations to industries\nThe starting point for each of the seven system\ntransformations was to identify the most relevant\nindustries that impact these transformations. Identification of industries was informed by scientific\nresearch, UN reports, government reports, industry publications and research by civil society\norganisations.\nWBA particularly focuses on the influence that specific industries have on shaping the\ntransformations. The influence of industries can be positive, where the industry enables or accelerates\nthe transformation; negative, where the industry hampers or negatively influences the transformation;\nor a combination of both.\nIndustries can be linked to multiple transformations. For example, companies producing agricultural\nproducts play a critical role in ensuring sustainable production and providing healthy and nutritious", "food (food and agriculture transformation), while also significantly impacting ecosystems (nature\ntransformation). Similarly, companies producing electronic devices and equipment enable the digital\ntransformation but also contribute to e-waste with a significant part of this waste ending up in\nlandfills (nature transformation).\nAlthough both positive and negative influences were considered, some industries were excluded from\nthe SDG2000 due to the large negative impact of their business models or products and services,\nthereby limiting their role in the transformations. These include, for example, companies that derive\nthe majority of their revenues from coal, tobacco and weapons.\n2.1.2 From industries to keystone companies\nWBA builds on the concept of \u2018'keystone species\u2019 in ecology, to illustrate how the largest companies in\nan industry can disproportionately affect the structure and the system in which they operate.7 WBA", "an industry can disproportionately affect the structure and the system in which they operate.7 WBA\nhas developed the idea of keystone companies drawing on five criteria, which have guided the\nidentification of the SDG2000 companies:\n1. The company dominates global production revenues and/or volumes within a particular sector.\nShaping tomorrow: The world's 2,000 most influential companies for the SDGs 4\n2. The company controls globally relevant segments of production and/or service provision.\n3. The company connects (eco)systems globally through subsidiaries and their supply chains.\n4. The company influences global governance processes and institutions.\n5. The company has a global footprint, particularly in developing countries.\nFor most industries, companies were initially screened based on revenues (criteria 1). Other keystone\nmetrics were applied depending on the system and industry, often using a combination of keystone", "metrics were applied depending on the system and industry, often using a combination of keystone\nmetrics alongside the latest reported annual revenues.8 Examples of keystone metrics include number\nof people served, number of subscribers, number of passengers and production volumes. SDG\ntracking indicators and SASB activity metrics informed the selection of keystone metrics for different\nindustries.9\nThe importance and role of particular sub-industries, business activities and segments of\nproduction/service provision in achieving the transformations were also taken into consideration\n(criteria 2). For example, for the agriculture and food system transformation, specific food groups such\nas dairy, fruit and vegetables, grains and oilseeds, livestock and seafood are considered key in the\nshift to healthy diets. For this reason, key players engaged in these food groups were explicitly\nincluded among the SDG2000. For the financial system transformation, the role of different sub-", "included among the SDG2000. For the financial system transformation, the role of different sub-\nindustries, such as asset owners, asset managers, banks and companies providing other financial\nservices in the flow of capital, was taken into consideration. For the decarbonisation and energy\nsystem transformation, the scale of different scopes of GHG emissions by industries was reviewed. For\ninstance, companies in the heavy machinery and electrical equipment industry were assessed for their\npotential to contribute to decarbonisation with a particular focus on scope 3 emissions (from product\nand service innovation). This type of research guided both the selection and exclusion of companies,\nas well as helped determine the total number of companies for each relevant industry.\nNext to researching companies\u2019 business models, product and service portfolios and geographical\npresence, their consumer base, subsidiary networks and supply chains were also reviewed (criteria 3).", "Additionally, company influence was also evaluated based on factors such as membership in industry\nand intergovernmental associations, as well as lobbying expenditures (criteria 4). Lastly, to ensure\nglobal relevance and spread, emphasis was placed on including companies with significant operations\nin low- and middle-income countries (criteria 5).\nFIGURE 2.2: NUMBER OF COMPANIES PER SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION\nThrough this process, a specific number\nof unique companies were selected to\nrepresent each of WBA\u2019s seven system\ntransformations (Figure 2.2). Together,\nthis amounts to 2,000 companies. It is\nimportant to note that companies can\nbe assessed in more than one\ntransformation. For instance, all\ncompanies are assessed in relation to\nthe social transformation, and the\nbenchmarks relating to the nature and\nurban transformations, next to\nassessing companies representing their\nspecific sectors, also assess companies\nthat are part of other transformations.", "specific sectors, also assess companies\nthat are part of other transformations.\nShaping tomorrow: The world's 2,000 most influential companies for the SDGs 5\n2.2 SDG2000 footprint\nThe SDG2000 companies hold dominant positions in their respective industries and are\nheadquartered across 83 economies, with operations spanning 221 economies across the globe. They\nprovide the vital food, energy, housing, Internet, transportation and financial systems that our\nsocieties depend on, and had collective revenues of USD 48 trillion in 2023, equivalent to 46% of\nglobal GDP. Moreover, they directly employ 99 million people and hundreds of millions more through\ntheir supply chains. Women account for an estimated 38% of the SDG2000 direct employees.\nThe majority (70%) of the SDG2000 companies are publicly listed, while 18% are privately held and\n12% are fully owned by governments (Figure 2.3, left).

However, for companies to effectively play their part, business leaders need to have a greater\nawareness of the systems\u2019 dynamics and long-term transformations. WBA recognises that for", "awareness of the systems\u2019 dynamics and long-term transformations. WBA recognises that for\ncompanies to transform in support of the global sustainability agenda, this needs to become\nconsequential to their success.\nThe SDGs are integrated into WBA\u2019s benchmark methodologies and the selection and assessment of\nthe SDG2000 companies in three ways:\n1. WBA benchmarking criteria for assessing the SDG2000 are linked to specific SDGs.\n2. Keystone metrics used to select the SDG2000 correspond to specific SDG tracking indicators.\n3. SDG2000 companies themselves identify the SDGs most relevant to their activities.\n3.1 Integrating the SDGs into WBA methodologies\nTo drive private sector action towards achieving the SDGs, WBA has developed methodologies to\nassess and benchmark companies\u2019 contributions to the seven identified system transformations\nrequired for a sustainable trajectory. These methodologies create clarity for companies in terms of", "required for a sustainable trajectory. These methodologies create clarity for companies in terms of\nwhat is expected from them: companies can use this information to change their policies, strategies\nand practices. Based on the methodologies, WBA collects data to carry out assessments of the\nSDG2000 companies. These assessments show where companies stand and how they can improve.\nWBA's benchmarks are free and publicly accessible so that everyone \u2013 including governments,\nShaping tomorrow: The world's 2,000 most influential companies for the SDGs 8\nfinancial institutions, civil society organisations and the media \u2013 can hold companies accountable for\ncontributing to sustainable development.\nWhile the SDGs and their targets are primarily designed for countries to implement, WBA\nmethodologies offer a framework that translates the SDG targets into actionable steps for companies\nto measure the progress they have made on their sustainability journey. Each WBA benchmark", "to measure the progress they have made on their sustainability journey. Each WBA benchmark\nmethodology contains a set of indicators informed by the SDGs. Currently, WBA benchmark\nmethodologies cover all the SDG goals across more than 120 indicators (Figure 3.2).\nFIGURE 3.2: NUMBER OF INDICATORS PRESENT IN WBA METHODOLOGIES PER SDG\nSDG1 No poverty 15\nSDG2 Zero hunger 10\nSDG3 Good health and well-being 14\nSDG4 Quality Education 4\nSDG5 Gender Equality 5\nSDG6 Clean water and sanitation 6\nSDG7 Affordable and clean energy 4\nSDG8 Decent work and economic growth 18\nSDG9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure 7\nSDG10 Reduced inequalities 15\nSDG11 Sustainable cities and communities 18\nSDG12 Responsible consumption and production 19\nSDG13 Climate action 17\nSDG14 Life below water 6\nSDG15 Life on land 12\nSDG16 Peace, justice and strong institutions 25\nSDG17 Partnership for the goal 5\nEach of WBA\u2019s seven system transformations and their benchmark methodologies relate to multiple", "Each of WBA\u2019s seven system transformations and their benchmark methodologies relate to multiple\nSDGs, taking into consideration the different sectoral focus of each of the systems. However, some\nSDGs are referred to more often, highlighting transversal objectives across the different systems. The\nmost common among these is SDG 16: Peace justice and strong institutions, which informs 25\nindicators across all the methodologies. These indicators evaluate the performance of companies on\ntopics such as commitment to human and workers\u2019 rights, lobbying practices, land rights and personal\ndata privacy. Each of the system transformations has indicators designed to measure strong\ninstitutions in an industry-specific context.\nAnother example is that of SDG 13: Climate action, which underpins the importance of including\nclimate change measures in strategies and policies across industries. Most transformations have", "climate change measures in strategies and policies across industries. Most transformations have\nindicators included in their respective benchmark methodologies that measure companies' GHG\nemissions and targets, making it a central topic within all system transformations.\nUnderstanding how WBA benchmark indicators are informed by the 17 goals is one aspect. However,\nthe overarching goals might not provide a detailed call to action. Along with the broader SDGs, the\ntargets that comprise each of the goals provide more detail on the steps needed to achieve the goal.\nConsequently, WBA\u2019s benchmark methodologies also cover a wide range of specific SDG targets, with\nthe most referenced targets being:\n\u2022 13.2 Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.\n\u2022 8.8 Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers,\nincluding migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment.", "including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment.\n\u2022 10.2 By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion for all,\nirrespective of age, sex, disabilities, ethnic, origin, religion or economic or other status.\nThese targets coincide with shared concerns across the seven systems. As mentioned previously, WBA\nhas developed a framework that does not place the focus solely on industries but rather recognises\ntransversal objectives. The protection of labour rights is one such central issue that touches many\nShaping tomorrow: The world's 2,000 most influential companies for the SDGs 9\nsectors. Based on the core concept of leaving nobody behind, several of the core social indicators\n(CSIs) take target 8.8 as reference to measure company efforts to ensure decent work and economic\ngrowth. Similarly, target 10.2 is present in several WBA methodologies, adapted to the specific", "growth. Similarly, target 10.2 is present in several WBA methodologies, adapted to the specific\nsectoral focus within the methodology. Some indicators informed by this target measure inclusivity for\npeople with disabilities, indigenous people\u2019s rights, as well as affordability and access to technology.\nSome transformations have clear mandates derived from specific SDGs. The decarbonisation and\nenergy transformation, for example, focuses mainly on SDG 13: Climate action, with half of the\nbenchmark indicators relating to this transformation measuring progress towards this goal. Similarly,\nthe benchmark methodology assessing the urban system transformation focuses mostly on indicators\nthat measure progress towards SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities, which include indicators\nfor measuring air pollution, waste minimisation and mobility.\nThe WBA methodologies also allow for a transversal view of company performance by SDG, across", "The WBA methodologies also allow for a transversal view of company performance by SDG, across\nindustries and system transformations. For example, even though there is no benchmark or system\ntransformation specific to health, WBA methodologies include 14 indicators that measure companies\u2019\nprogress towards SDG 3: Good health and well-being. These indicators are concentrated in the Food\nand Agriculture, Nature and Urban Benchmarks and range across topics from food safety and\nantibiotic use to access to open spaces.\nAnother example is SDG 4: Quality education, which is targeted in both the digital transformation and\ndecarbonisation and energy transformation benchmark methodologies. In relation to the digital\ntransformation, this goal links to companies\u2019 efforts to promote skills that enable the use of\ntechnology. The decarbonisation and energy transformation, on the other hand, looks at indicators", "technology. The decarbonisation and energy transformation, on the other hand, looks at indicators\nrelated to the upskilling of workers for an inclusive and balanced workforce to achieve a just\ntransition.\n3.2 Integrating the SDGs into company selection criteria\nIn addition to informing the indicators used in WBA\u2019s benchmark methodologies, the SDGs are also\nembedded in the industry-specific keystone metrics used for selecting companies in WBA\u2019s SDG2000\nlist. This means that the SDGs are not only a framework for assessing company performance but also\na foundational element in determining which companies are most influential in driving progress\ntowards specific SDG targets.\nThere are two different ways of looking at the link between the SDGs and keystone metrics. First, the\noverall SDGs themselves may be broadly related to some keystone criteria. Financial institutions'\nassets under management (AUM), for example, are in line with SDG: 9 Industry, innovation and", "assets under management (AUM), for example, are in line with SDG: 9 Industry, innovation and\ninfrastructure and SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals, since AUM may support investment projects\nthat advance industrialisation, innovation, resilient infrastructure and financial assistance for\ndeveloping countries. For pharmaceutical companies, the number of patients treated, along with the\nnumber of drugs in the portfolio and those in research and development, are directly pertinent to\nvarious targets associated with SDG 3: Good health and well-being.\nThe second approach focuses on identifying keystone metrics that correspond to specific SDG targets\nand tracking indicators.11 In this case, keystone metrics function as tracking indicators to monitor the\ncompany\u2019s progress towards achieving the SDGs. The keystone metrics also demonstrate the footprint\nof the SDG2000 companies, indicating which companies have the biggest impact on specific SDG\ntargets.", "targets.\nThe proportion of population with access to electricity is a tracking indicator for SDG\n7: Affordable and clean energy.

This impact extends\nbeyond those they directly employ to those engaged in their supply chains. In\nparticular, a company's activities create employment in ancillary sectors that provide\nessential inputs, resulting in a ripple effect of job creation. This relates to SDG 8 on\npromoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and\nproductive employment and decent work for all.\nEstimating the number of workers involved in companies\u2019 supply chains is challenging given the\ncomplexity of supply chains and labour requirements, which vary per industry.

Agriculture and\ngarments are considered labour-intensive sectors and employ more people compared to industries\nthat rely more on technology, such as electronics manufacturing.\nThe apparel and footwear industry\u2019s supply chain spans several phases, from manufacturing and\ndistribution, to retail and recycling. Its operations and downstream supply chain alone can be divided\ninto five stages: Tier 0 representing direct employment, which includes those employed in company\noffices, retail locations and distribution centres; Tier 1 representing suppliers involved in the\nmanufacturing and assembly of final products; Tier 2 representing suppliers involved in the\nproduction and finishing of materials that are directly used in the finished products; Tier 3\nrepresenting suppliers focused on the processing of raw materials into intermediate products, such as", "yarn, leather and synthetic fibres; and Tier 4 representing suppliers involved in the cultivation and\nextraction of raw materials, such as the production of cotton, leather and wool. This complexity is\nfurther amplified by businesses providing inputs to the apparel and footwear industry, which in turn\ngenerate more jobs.\nWBA has developed a framework for estimating the workforce in the supply chain of apparel and\nfootwear companies included among its SDG2000 list. The framework starts with assessing\ninformation disclosed by some companies, such as the number of workers in their supply chains and\ndetailed factory-level data. While most companies report their Tier 1 supplier lists, some go a step\nfurther and also report their Tier 2 suppliers.

EU Directive", "(2021/2101/EU) extends the requirement for public disclosure of CbC reports to all multinationals\noperating in the EU with global revenues exceeding EUR 750 million (USD 773 million). 88 This\nrequirement will begin with the 2026 reporting year. Subsidiaries of non-EU headquartered\nmultinationals operating in the EU must also comply, but only for their EU-based activities.\nGiven this legislation, soon all the overseas taxes paid and locations of EU multinationals will be\navailable, significantly contributing to research about tax transparency and corporate globalisation.89\nHowever, unless the requirement of public CbC reporting is applied more widely there will be a dearth\nof information regarding companies headquartered in other regions. Notably, none of the top ten\nbanks by assets currently publish a public CbC report.\nInvestor-led actions advocating for greater tax transparency by multinationals could result in greater", "public CbC reporting for companies outside the EU.90 Such action may gain momentum as tax\ndiscrepancies become more widely publicised. For instance, a United States Senate investigation\nrevealed that pharmaceutical company AbbVie paid just 1% of its taxes in the United States, the\ncountry of its headquarters, despite generating 75% of its sales there.91 The company claims it\ndiscloses a CbC report to tax authorities in its tax position policy, something it is required to do.\nHowever, it does not make the report publicly available. AbbVie claims the taxes it pays support the\ncommunities it operates in, but without a public CbC report this claim is impossible to verify.92\nShaping tomorrow: The world's 2,000 most influential companies for the SDGs 37\n5 Going forward\nThe SDG2000 are critical to achieving the SDGs by creating employment, building skills, mitigating\nenvironmental impacts, providing essential infrastructure and supplying affordable goods and", "environmental impacts, providing essential infrastructure and supplying affordable goods and\nservices. WBA collects information on the world's 2,000 most influential companies to better\nunderstand and demonstrate their footprints. As shown throughout this report, the dominance of\nthese companies in various industries has tremendous relevance for a number of SDG targets and\nidentifies areas where the SDG2000 needs to be held accountable. Going forward, WBA will expand\ncollection of data to deepen knowledge around the scope of the SDG2000 and its economic,\nenvironmental, and social impact on sustainable development.\nMapping supply and value chains. The highlight on apparel and footwear companies illustrates that\na company\u2019s impact extends beyond its own operations, reaching its supply chain. Companies can\ninfluence suppliers by requiring them to adhere to their codes of conduct and establishing", "influence suppliers by requiring them to adhere to their codes of conduct and establishing\nexpectations for ethical practices, environmental standards and working conditions as part of their\nsupplier contracts. For instance, many companies mandate that suppliers pay at least the minimum\nwage. However, suppliers retain discretion over determining the exact wages paid to workers, which\nmay result in disparities between the actual wage earned by workers and a living wage. Bridging this\ngap requires stronger collaboration and accountability mechanisms to ensure fair treatment and\nsustainable practices. WBA will extend analysis in this area by calculating the number of supply chain\nworkers and living wages for additional industries.\nDifferent industries have different responsibilities for impacts across the same value chain. The\nhighlight on plastics shows that identifying corporate accountability in multifaceted value chains is", "complex with plastics producers, manufacturers of plastic containers and companies using plastic\npackaging all accountable for plastics pollution. Similarly, the highlight on digital companies shows\nthe need for them to accelerate GHG emissions reduction. As the same time, many digital companies\nare paying for renewable energy but not getting it at the locations where they need it, illustrating the\nneed for electric utilities to accelerate the greening of grids. WBA will continue to identify relevant\nlinked industries across different value chains to highlight accountabilities.\nWidening analysis of environmental impacts. WBA's decarbonization and energy transformation\nhas been benchmarking high GHG emitting industries for several years, addressing SDGs 7 Affordable\nand Clean Energy and 13 Climate Action. This analysis will be expanded across the entire SDG2000,\ncomplementing the social transformation which already covers all 2,000 companies.", "complementing the social transformation which already covers all 2,000 companies.\nThe SDG2000 has wider environmental impacts beyond climate. For instance, the plastics highlight\ndocumented the negative environmental impact of plastics pollution. Some of these environmental\naspects are covered by the nature transformation. Coverage will be enhanced to include\nenvironmental impacts relevant to all types of companies (e.g., water and waste) as well as those\nrelevant to specific industries, enhancing understanding of the impacts of the SDG2000 on SDGs such\nas 6 Clean Water and Sanitation, 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, 14 Life Below Water\nand 15 Life on Land.\nUnderstanding global reach. Many of the SDG2000 operate in multiple countries as the highlight on\nbanks demonstrates.

For instance, WBA benchmarks consist of\nindicators linked to specific SDGs which can be used to track progress. SDG tracking indicators can be\nlinked to the keystone metrics used to select the SDG2000, useful for identifying which SDGs specific\nindustries and companies have a significant impact on. Finally, some companies identify which SDGs\nthey contribute to through their operations and social responsibility programmes. Efforts will continue\nto make these SDG links more explicit. This includes deepening understanding about the role of social\nresponsibility programmes for contributing to the SDGs.

It does this by publishing free and publicly available\nbenchmarks on their performance.", "benchmarks on their performance.\nWBA shows what good corporate practice looks like so that leading companies have an incentive to\nkeep progressing and laggards feel pressure to catch up. WBA has identified seven systems that, if\ntransformed, have the greatest potential to put our society, planet and economy on a more\nsustainable and resilient path. These are the transformation of our social system, our agriculture and\nfood system, our decarbonisation and energy system, our nature system, our digital system, our urban\nsystem and our financial system.\nBy benchmarking companies on each system transformation, WBA reveals where each company\nstands in comparison to its peers, where it can improve and where urgent action is needed. The\nbenchmarks provide companies with a clear roadmap of the commitments and changes they must\nmake. Over time, they will show whether or not these 2,000 companies are improving their business", "make. Over time, they will show whether or not these 2,000 companies are improving their business\nimpact on people, workers, communities and the environment. The benchmarks equip everyone \u2013\nincluding the community of WBA Allies comprising about 420 organisations \u2013 with the insights that\nthey need to collectively ensure that the private sector delivers on the imperative transformations.\nFor more information, visit www.worldbenchmarkingalliance.org.
