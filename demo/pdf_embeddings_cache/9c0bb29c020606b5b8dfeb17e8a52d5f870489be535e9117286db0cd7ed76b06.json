When I took office, our economy was in\nthe grips of worst pandemic in a century, and decades of trickle-down poli-\ncies had left us especially vulnerable to its shocks. Hundreds of thousands of\nbusinesses had closed, and millions of Americans risked losing their homes.\nUnemployment was high and the risk of long-term damage was real.\nMy Administration responded with a new economic playbook to\nrebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down.\nSince then, we\u2019ve made historic investments in our nation and in the indus-\ntries of the future. We\u2019ve stood by unions and helped to create a record 16\nmillion jobs. We\u2019ve fought to lower costs for consumers, and to give small\nbusinesses a fair chance to compete. Today, our economy has not only\nrecovered, it has emerged stronger, laying the foundation for a promising\nnew chapter in the American comeback story.", "new chapter in the American comeback story.\nMy Council of Economic Advisers has prepared this report examining\nactions taken to both ease the pandemic\u2019s immediate impact and strengthen\nour economy over the long-term, to help ensure we learn the right lessons as\na nation and to build on the historic progress we\u2019ve made.\nOur work began right away with the American Rescue Plan, one of the\nmost consequential recovery packages in history. To reopen our economy,\nwe knew we had to defeat COVID-19, so we launched unprecedented vac-\ncination efforts. We got immediate economic relief out to tens of millions\nof families who needed it most. We expanded the Child Tax Credit, cut-\nting child poverty in half to its lowest rate in history. And we sent funding\ndirectly to every state, city, and town in the nation, keeping police on the\nbeat and teachers in the classroom, families in their homes and small busi-\nnesses on their feet, preventing a wave of scarring bankruptcies, defaults,\nand evictions.", "nesses on their feet, preventing a wave of scarring bankruptcies, defaults,\nand evictions.\nAt the same time, the pandemic had snarled supply chains and set off\nwidespread labor shortages, driving up costs worldwide. In response, my\nAdministration immediately convened businesses and labor to unclog our\nports and get goods flowing. Russia\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified invasion\nof Ukraine further increased food and gas prices. In response, I directed the\nEconomic Report of the President | 3\nlargest release of fuel from our strategic reserve in history to ensure that our\nenergy markets were well supplied, and we challenged oil and gas compa-\nnies to reinvest record profits in domestic production, which has reached\nan all-time high under my Administration. And we took steps to promote\ncompetition across industries, boosting transparency and lowering costs\nfor consumers.\nOur approach worked. Inflation is down significantly from its peak and", "for consumers.\nOur approach worked. Inflation is down significantly from its peak and\nis now close to pre-pandemic levels. Together, we\u2019ve achieved the elusive\n\u201csoft landing\u201d of lower inflation, steady employment, strong economic\ngrowth, and rising real wages \u2013 which most observers said was impossible.\nBut ending the economic crisis alone was never enough. I ran for\nPresident to set the American economy on a stronger long-term course,\nby breaking from the trickle-down orthodoxy that has failed our nation\nfor decades. That theory holds that by cutting taxes for the very wealthy,\nbenefits will trickle down to everyone else. But in truth, not a lot has ever\ntrickled down onto most folks\u2019 kitchen tables. Instead, inequality grew and\nAmerica slid deeper into debt.\nI have a different approach. I believe the best way to build America\nis to invest in America, in American products and American people. And\nthe best way to grow our economy is to grow the backbone of our nation:", "the best way to grow our economy is to grow the backbone of our nation:\nthe middle class. That\u2019s what my Investing in America agenda has done,\nthrough landmark laws that shore up our infrastructure, our manufactur-\ning base, and our people. Together, these are some of the most significant\ninvestments in America since the New Deal.\nFor decades, American infrastructure has been neglected. But our\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law is finally modernizing the nation\u2019s roads,\nbridges, ports, airports, transit systems, and more; removing every lead pipe\nin America, so every child can drink clean water; and providing affordable\nhigh-speed internet for every American, no matter where they live. And it\u2019s\nmaking sure these projects are done with American products and American\nworkers, creating hundreds of thousands of good-paying new jobs, many of\nthem union jobs.\nFor too long, American factories have moved overseas, taking vital\nindustries with them.

Now, our CHIPS and Science Act is bringing manu-\nfacturing home, already attracting nearly $450 billion in manufacturing\ninvestments to build massive new semiconductor factories, equipping\nAmerica to lead the industries of future. At the same time, our Inflation\nReduction Act is making the most significant investment in fighting climate\nchange in history, not only putting America on track to halve carbon emis-\nsions by 2030 and promoting our energy abundance and security, but also\ncreating hundreds of thousands of good-paying clean-energy jobs.\n4 | Economic Report of the President\nII kknnooww aallll ttoooo wweellll,, AAmmeerriiccaannss ssttiillll ttoooo oofftteenn ssttrruuggggllee ttoo aaffffoorrdd lliiffee--\nssaavviinngg pprreessccrriippttiioonn ddrruuggss,, aanndd ssoommeettiimmeess aarree eevveenn ffoorrcceedd ttoo cchhoooossee bbeettwweeeenn", "mmeeddiicciinnee aanndd rreenntt..

a once-in-a-century global pandemic. The economy was in the throes\nof one of the deepest macroeconomic shocks since the Great Depression,\nand while unemployment was down from its peak, it was still highly\nelevated. The Administration took immediate and decisive action to offset\nthe impact of the two-sided pandemic shock\u2014to both the economy\u2019s sup-\nply and demand sides\u2014and lay the groundwork for a lasting, durable, and\ninclusive recovery.\nThe 2025 Economic Report of the President, the fourth and last of the\nAdministration, provides careful analyses of how the Administration has\nimplemented public policy to achieve the President\u2019s economic goals.\nIt begins by reviewing macroeconomic trends over the past four years,", "It begins by reviewing macroeconomic trends over the past four years,\nillustrating the path from economic uncertainty to robust growth and a\nhistorically strong labor market. It then delves into specific topics within\nlabor markets, tax policy, healthcare, climate policy, international trade,\nand education to examine how policy implementation can make a tangible,\npositive difference in the lives of families and communities.\nMany of these policy details rarely make headlines either on traditional or\nsocial media. But, as this volume shows, well-designed policies can help\nstruggling families and address consequential market failures, just as failing\nto make such interventions can stall or reverse progress.\nFor example, chapter 4 of this Report highlights more than a dozen specific\nhealthcare policies that together helped boost health insurance enrollment to\na record high. Chapter 5 highlights numerous policies summing to the larg-", "a record high. Chapter 5 highlights numerous policies summing to the larg-\nest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy, which are helping to bend the arc\nof U.S. carbon emissions. Chapter 6 highlights how investment incentives\n17\ncreated through the Inflation Reduction Act have attracted record foreign\ndirect investment. Addressing the sobering reality of pandemic-era learning\nlosses, chapter 7 highlights numerous actions taken by federal policymakers\nto aid academic recovery following the pandemic.\nElsewhere, this Report highlights additional policy action that may be\nneeded to respond to broad economic trends. Chapter 2 explores structural\nchanges to the U.S. labor market brought about by remote work and poten-\ntial new policy challenges and opportunities. Chapter 3 explains why U.S.\nparticipation in the Global Tax Deal is necessary for shoring up tax revenue\nfrom multinational corporations operating across numerous tax regimes in", "from multinational corporations operating across numerous tax regimes in\nvarious countries. Taken together, the Report\u2019s chapters illustrate the differ-\nence that competent policy creation and implementation can make in build-\ning an economy based on fairness, opportunity, and broadly shared growth.\nChapter 1: Four Years in Review and the Years Ahead\nThe U.S. post-pandemic recovery is an unusual and, in many ways, remark-\nable period in macroeconomic history. Among the most notable trends is\nthe speed at which the U.S. economy returned to full employment and how\ndurable full employment has been. When President Biden took office in\nJanuary 2021, the unemployment rate was still elevated at 6.4 percent and\npayroll employment was well below its pre-pandemic level. In far less time\nthan in past recoveries, the economy surpassed the pre-pandemic level of\nreal GDP, entering a robust expansion that consistently exceeded forecast-", "real GDP, entering a robust expansion that consistently exceeded forecast-\ners\u2019 expectations. Figure i-1 shows how the actual unemployment rate came\nin lower than even the most optimistic Blue Chip forecasts through the\nsecond quarter of 2024. This uniquely strong job market helped support real\nwage and income gains, which in turn bolstered consumer spending. The\nBiden-Harris investment agenda was also consequential to the recovery and\nlong-term health of the economy by crowding in private capital in support\nof key sectors, including clean energy and semiconductors.\nDuring the pandemic, nearly all advanced economies experienced a\nspike in inflation, which climbed to levels not seen in decades. At the time\nof this writing, the spike had largely dissipated in the United States. What\nfactors were behind inflation\u2019s rise and fall? The CEA has long shown that\nthe inflation surge was driven by the collision of strong demand and snarled", "the inflation surge was driven by the collision of strong demand and snarled\nsupply. This view has been further supported by the extent of disinflation\n18 |\nFigure i-1.

Chapter 1 carefully reviews the\ndetails of inflation\u2019s roundtrip.\nThe chapter concludes with two policy lessons from the past four\nyears. Hitting back hard and fast against exogenous shocks is one key les-\nson, both to quickly return to full employment and to avoid scarring effects\nthat can persistently damage economic performance. The second lesson is\nthe urgent need to reform one of the nation\u2019s first lines of counter-cyclical\ndefense: the unemployment insurance (UI) program. The enormous expan-\nsion of UI during the COVID-19 era served as a critical stabilizer, but it also\nstretched the capacity of an antiquated system. In the spirit of \u201cfixing the\nroof when the sun is shining,\u201d policymakers would be smart to engage in\nneeded reforms, many of which are cited in chapter 1. The chapter concludes\nwith the Administration\u2019s 10-year forecast.\nIntroduction | 19\nChapter 2: How Remote Work Is Reshaping the Economy", "Introduction | 19\nChapter 2: How Remote Work Is Reshaping the Economy\nThe rise of remote work is one of the more economically important labor\nmarket legacies of the pandemic. Chapter 2 is largely motivated by the\nfigure below, which shows an elevated level of remote work relative to just\na few years ago (figure i-2). Many employers and workers have continued\nto operate in either fully remote or hybrid work models since the pandemic,\nwith improved technology and new workplace practices supporting the\ntrend.\nIt will take time for researchers to fully understand the economic\nimplications of this fundamental shift in the structure of work. Available evi-\ndence suggests that remote work comes with benefits and costs to employers\nand employees. It is a valued job amenity that can reduce barriers to access-\ning the labor market\u2014for example, for those with disabilities or caregiv-\ning responsibilities. Remote work is also likely to leave an imprint on the", "ing responsibilities. Remote work is also likely to leave an imprint on the\ngeographic pattern of economic activity as it loosens locational constraints\nto matching workers with suitable jobs. At the same time, remote work\nposes real challenges to businesses because some of the traditional benefits\nFigure i-2.

With\nfull information about the future, policymakers may have allocated fiscal\nsupport differently. With the benefit of hindsight, there are three lessons\nfrom the fiscal response that can inform policy in future crises, and one\nconclusion that policymakers should be careful to avoid.\nFirst, timing matters. When facing a crisis such as this one that\nabruptly shutters economic activity, the cost of delaying action can far\noutweigh the resources saved by fine-tuning fiscal policies to reach only the\nmost affected households and businesses. Proactive development of policy\ninfrastructure\u2014such as automatic stabilizers via the tax system, unemploy-", "infrastructure\u2014such as automatic stabilizers via the tax system, unemploy-\nment insurance (UI), SNAP, or other benefits\u2014minimizes the delays associ-\nated with targeting support in future recessions, shifting the policy calculus.\nSecond, the optimal policy choice depends on whether the primary\ngoal is demand management or social insurance. Direct household relief,\n18 A CEA analysis finds the expanded CTC\u2019s expiration after 2021 is responsible for more than half\nof the observed child poverty increase (CEA 2023c).\n19 Another benefit over the period was increased health insurance coverage. See chapter 4 in this\nvolume for more on the topic.\n74 | Chapter 1\nsuch as the Economic Impact Payments, can be an effective form of social\ninsurance (Dynan 2022). It was impossible to predict which households\nwould be hardest hit in a once-in-a-century global health event; widespread\nsupport prevented hardship for many affected households. An important", "support prevented hardship for many affected households. An important\nsecondary effect was strengthened balance sheets for remaining households,\nwith impacts on consumer spending, growth, and inflation, as discussed in\nthis chapter. In a pure demand shortfall, effective targeting is an important\ntenet of fiscal stimulus (Elmendorf and Furman 2008), but widespread\nhousehold support is superior when the social insurance objective takes\nprecedence.\nThird, in a crisis with large and asymmetric downside risk, policy-\nmakers should err toward a stronger fiscal response than when risks are\nbalanced. In January 2021, the Administration recognized inaction posed\nthe greatest risk to the macroeconomy, with a potential consequence of\nprolonged economic distress. Past crises delivered hard-won lessons about\nthe long-term harm caused by sustained elevated unemployment, including\nerosion in workers\u2019 skills and weakened productivity (CEA 2024a; Yellen", "erosion in workers\u2019 skills and weakened productivity (CEA 2024a; Yellen\n2016). There are risks to robust fiscal action\u2014including rising prices\u2014but\na strong fiscal response can deliver durable growth, and the risk of under-\nreacting to a large global shock is material.\nFinally, the emergence of inflation does not negate the wisdom of\na strong fiscal response. This chapter presents strong evidence that post-\npandemic inflation was the result of weakened supply in addition to strong\ndemand, suggesting that some inflation was an inevitable consequence of\nthe pandemic\u2019s reshaping of supply and demand forces. The fact that most\nadvanced economies experienced substantial cumulative inflation despite\nemploying different fiscal responses underscores this point. Additionally,\nthe Federal Reserve is well positioned to respond to demand-driven inflation\nwhen it arises. Inflation harms businesses and families across the income", "when it arises. Inflation harms businesses and families across the income\ndistribution (Jaravel 2024), but the prospect of future inflation must be bal-\nanced against labor market pain amid a large, negative shock. Furthermore,\nthe imperatives to act swiftly and deliver social insurance are amplified\nduring periods of heightened uncertainty.\nFour Years in Review and the Years Ahead | 75\nUnemployment Insurance\n\u201cUnfortunately, people often only pay attention to\nthese [unemployment insurance reform] issues at\nthe wrong time: in the middle of a recession, or a\nweek before people are going to lose their extended\nbenefits\u2014or, even worse, a week after they have lost\ntheir extended benefits, as happened more than once\nin recent years.\u201d\n\u2013 CEA Chairman Jason Furman, July 2016\nThe pandemic spotlighted the need for UI system reform.

In contrast,\nduring the budget window\u2019s final five years beginning in 2031, this down-\nward pull on the participation rate decreases. Because of the boost from\nthe Administration\u2019s policies, together with the diminishing downward\ndemographic pull, potential GDP growth is expected to be stronger during\nthe last six years of the forecast interval (2030\u20132035) than during the first\nfive years (2025\u20132029).\nThe CEA\u2019s methodology relies on Okun\u2019s Law to estimate potential\nreal GDP growth during the past roughly two decades, as shown in figure\n1-37, which illustrates the relationship between the change in the unem-", "1-37, which illustrates the relationship between the change in the unem-\nployment rate and the growth rate of real output.24 The rate of real potential\noutput growth is estimated as the rate of real output (the average of real GDP\nand GDI) growth consistent with a stable unemployment rate\u2014represented\nas the location where the regression line crosses the x-axis, at 1.85 percent.\nThe 1.85 percent estimate represents the average rate of potential output\ngrowth during the estimation interval, but it does not imply that the potential\noutput growth rate was constant. Rather, potential output growth varied\nover the historical interval and likely will vary over the forecast interval in\nresponse to demographic and other factors.\nThe CEA\u2019s methodology results in a higher estimate of potential GDP\ngrowth than was produced by the same exercise one year ago because of the\nnotable upward revision to real output growth from the Bureau of Economic", "notable upward revision to real output growth from the Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis\u2019s annual revision in September 2024. In that revision, output\ngrowth (measured as the average of real GDP and real GDI) was revised up\nby roughly 0.7 percentage point per year during the three years from 2021\nthrough 2023. As shown in figure 1-37, the three datapoints for 2021, 2022,\nand 2023 moved rightward, causing the x-intercept (i.e., the estimate of\npotential real GDP growth) to move rightward, as well.\n24 Former CEA Chairman Arthur Okun proposed what came to be known as Okun\u2019s Law in 1962\n(Okun 1962).

The Administration expects\nCPI inflation to fall slightly further during 2025 to 2.3 percent, a rate that is\nconsistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2.0 percent target for the PCE Price\nIndex. CPI inflation tends to run higher than PCE inflation; over the 45\nyears through 2023, CPI inflation exceeded PCE inflation by 0.3 percentage", "years through 2023, CPI inflation exceeded PCE inflation by 0.3 percentage\npoint.25 The price index for GDP\u2014a measure of inflation for everything\nproduced in the United States\u2014is expected to fall from a forecasted 2.4\npercent during 2024 to 2.2 percent during 2025.\nIn response to an increase in inflation, the FOMC raised the federal\nfunds rate in 2022 and 2023, then let it plateau at roughly 5.3 percent for\nmore than a year. Following evidence of a decline in inflation, the FOMC\ntook the first step down from that plateau in September 2024 and another\nstep in November. The three-month Treasury bill (T-bill) rate also fell\naround the same time. Looking ahead, as inflation settles near the FOMC\u2019s\ntarget, further declines in T-bill rates are expected by private professional\nforecasters, the FOMC, and the Administration, with the caveat that the\nFOMC\u2019s future rate cuts will be data dependent.

In\nparticular, students who endured pandemic-era restrictions may not have\nacquired human capital at the same pace as the pre-pandemic generations.\nKane et al.

Incorporating human capital loss into the Administration\u2019s forecast\nin this iteration partially offsets upwardly revised estimates to potential real\nGDP growth due to the data revisions discussed earlier.

Instead of commuting to an office five days a week, many\nAmerican workers now do their job from home at least some of the time.\nIn some cases, fully remote jobs remove the need to live near one\u2019s employer\nand dramatically change how workers interact with each other. In other\ncases, partially remote jobs provide a mixture of traditional and remote", "cases, partially remote jobs provide a mixture of traditional and remote\nworkplace experiences. This matters for wellbeing and wages, access to\njobs, and where workers decide to reside. Labor and housing markets oper-\nate differently in a world where either type of remote work is common, with\ndownstream effects for governments, downtowns, and the U.S. economy.\nIn spring 2020, the surge in remote work was inextricably linked to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. It was unclear at the time whether remote work would\npersist at levels much higher than those in the pre-pandemic period, and it\nwas difficult to disentangle its labor market footprint from that of the pan-\ndemic itself. But as the pandemic subsided and remote work, also known as\ntelework, remained, it became possible to learn more about the phenomenon\nand its effects.\nAs of late 2024, remote work appeared to be a key labor market experience\nof at least 20 percent of the American workforce, roughly half of whom", "of at least 20 percent of the American workforce, roughly half of whom\nwere fully remote and half of whom were partially remote (i.e., hybrid). For\ncontext, this share is roughly double that of workers represented by unions\nand about the same share of the workforce with an occupational license, two\ngroups deservedly receiving considerable research focus.\n89\nFor many Americans, remote work has improved the working experience\nand added valuable labor market options. Employers who offer remote\nwork can draw on expanded talent pools\u2014including workers needing\nflexible work arrangements as well as workers across the country\u2014when\nfilling open positions. However, in many instances remote work remains\ntechnically infeasible or inordinately costly for businesses to implement.\nEmerging research also points to costs of remote work in the form of\nreduced collaboration: less-experienced workers are especially likely to miss\nout on valuable feedback and mentoring. Because these benefits and costs", "out on valuable feedback and mentoring. Because these benefits and costs\nvary widely across workers and firms, experimentation by employers will\ngenerate valuable information and help achieve better outcomes.\nA striking fact about remote workers is just how likely they are to possess\nother labor market advantages. On average, they have more education and\nhigher incomes than non-remote workers. Remote work\u2014like other non-\nwage benefits\u2014therefore tends to be part of a larger pattern of labor market\ninequality. For example, Black and Hispanic workers are less likely to work\nremotely than Asian and white workers.\nLike other large, abrupt economic changes, the shift to remote work can also\nbe disruptive. Long-established patterns of economic activity, particularly\nin housing markets, stand to be altered by remote work. Exploiting the\nopportunities and minimizing the costs of remote work is a joint challenge\nfor workers, businesses, and policymakers.", "for workers, businesses, and policymakers.\nThis chapter examines who currently works remotely. It then provides an\neconomic framework for thinking about remote work\u2019s labor market impli-\ncations.

The analysis is especially\nfocused on job search and matching, but also on geographic sorting\u2014all key\naspects of labor market function likely to be reshaped by remote work.

Much of the increase during 2020 and 2021 was\nimpelled by public health concerns associated with the pandemic. And some\nof the increase did prove temporary, as many workers were called back to\nthe office when the pandemic abated.\nHowever, the share of workers reporting some amount of remote work\nhas stabilized in recent years and even increased. From September 2023 to\nSeptember 2024, the share reported in the SWAA rose from 19.8 percent to\n23.7 percent.

Earlier in\nthe pandemic, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) asked workers if they\nteleworked specifically because of COVID-19. By the time that question\nwas discontinued after September 2022, the share of all workers who tele-\nworked because of COVID-19 had already plummeted from 35.4 percent of\nemployees in May 2020 to 5.2 percent.\nThe large-scale social and economic experiment prompted by the\npandemic has generated durable improvements in teleworking technology\nand practices, as well as new information about remote work\u2019s efficacy and\ndesirability. As pointed out by Davis (2024), the pandemic allowed employ-\ners to learn what would happen when large shares of workers collaborated\nvirtually across entire industries, information that could not have been", "virtually across entire industries, information that could not have been\ndiscovered by a single employer experimenting in isolation.4 Employers\nresponded to the new technology and information by making choices\u2014\noften quite varied even for firms in the same industry employing similar\nworkers\u2014about how to structure their workplace (Hansen et al. 2023).\nEmployers continue to experiment with remote work, and use of the practice\ncould rise or fall based on their unique experiences, but it appears to be here\nto stay for many workers.5\nWho Works Remotely?\nA bit more than one fifth of the workforce now works remotely at some\npoint during their workweek.

To begin answering that question, the CEA considers how", "the labor market? To begin answering that question, the CEA considers how\nemployers structure the jobs that they create. When an employer looks to\nfill an open job, it sets a wage, certain non-wage benefits (e.g., health insur-\nance), and terms of employment (e.g., required work hours and the option to\nwork remotely). The particular combination of non-wage benefits and terms\nthat workers encounter (and in some cases, negotiate) are determined by the\ninterplay of (i) available technology, (ii) job design and managerial prac-\ntices, (iii) a worker\u2019s preferences, and (iv) the balance of bargaining power.\nFirst, jobs differ in the type of work performed and the available\ntechnology, including the computer equipment and software provided to\nemployees. The technology and the physical constraints related to specific\ntasks affect the cost of imposing different job conditions. For example,\nremote work may be low cost for an office worker but infeasible for a", "remote work may be low cost for an office worker but infeasible for a\nconstruction worker.10 Even in cases where remote work is feasible, it could\ndegrade productivity if collaboration is more difficult than it would be in\nperson.\n10 Technology is not the only kind of limitation; institutional and legal constraints also exist. For\ninstance, state licensure rules could make it costly for a medical professional to advise out-of-state\npatients remotely (Maheu 2024).\n100 | Chapter 2\nSecond, jobs are defined by how employees are directed to work. A\ntechnology might exist for some time before businesses figure out how to use\nit effectively. In the case of remote work, new management practices might\nbe called for, as when supervising and motivating the work of employees\nwhose effort cannot be directly monitored at a workplace. Workers them-\nselves may learn over time how best to interact with remote colleagues.\nThird, workers have their own preferences about non-wage benefits,", "Third, workers have their own preferences about non-wage benefits,\nthe ways in which they conduct their work, and other conditions of employ-\nment. When employees value remote work to a greater degree, employers\ntend to make it more available, though possibly at a cost to wages or other\nnon-wage benefits. Employers do not necessarily do so out of regard for\ntheir workers, but because supplying a remote work option may be less\nexpensive than paying the wage premium required to attract workers to a\nnon-remote job. This wage difference is what economists call a compensat-\ning differential, with workers accepting less money in exchange for some\nother non-wage benefit they desire.\nFinally, the balance of bargaining power affects remote work options.\nWhen labor markets are strong and competition is fierce, both wages and\ndesirable non-wage amenities (i.e., the benefits and conditions of work) are\nabundant (CEA 2024a). The strong post-pandemic labor market, therefore,", "abundant (CEA 2024a). The strong post-pandemic labor market, therefore,\nmay have been a contributor to the sustained rise in remote work (Autor,\nDube, and McGrew 2024).\nSearch and matching\nWorkers and firms tend to sort themselves based on the differing value they\napply to remote work. As emphasized in Davis (2024), individuals with the\nhighest valuation of working remotely look for jobs in which they can do\nso, and firms with the lowest cost of doing so supply the remote work jobs.\nAfter the sudden pandemic-era rise in remote work, re-sorting likely\naffected a variety of labor market outcomes (Bagga et al. 2024). For\ninstance, a person with a non-remote job at a medical practice might have\nleft their job to become a medical records specialist in a remote capacity,\nleading to increased job churn.\nRemote work, however, is not only an amenity. Fully remote work\u2014\nand to a lesser extent, hybrid remote work\u2014also substantially relaxes the", "and to a lesser extent, hybrid remote work\u2014also substantially relaxes the\ngeographic constraints on the jobs workers can take. When work occurs\nin person, only a relatively small group of workers and firms, limited by\nproximity, can effectively search for each other and form matches. By con-\ntrast, when a job is advertised as fully remote, a broader pool of potential\napplicants can consider the job.\nRemote work therefore offers the potential to lower the degree of\nmismatch across local labor markets. Focusing on geography, mismatch\nHow Remote Work is Reshaping the Economy | 101\narises when job vacancies and workers seeking jobs are unbalanced across\nlocal labor markets (Shimer 2007). The process is inefficient: Overall hiring\nwould be faster if workers in areas with weak demand could access vacan-\ncies from places with strong demand. By reducing geographic barriers,\nremote work has the potential to ameliorate the mismatch.", "remote work has the potential to ameliorate the mismatch.\nIn addition to raising hiring rates, diminished geographic barriers\ncan lead to improved hiring. Because workers and firms have their unique\ncharacteristics, it becomes easier to form the best possible matches when\njob search is less costly. Remote work could have an impact in this regard:\nNow that workers and employers can search outside their own local labor\nmarkets, they can achieve better matches that fit the skills and preferences\nof workers, as well as the needs of employers. Each of these potential effects\nwarrants further testing with real-world data.\nGeographic sorting\nTo the extent that remote work relaxes geographic restrictions on workers\nand businesses, it also affects where the individuals and firms choose to\nlocate. A standard economic model of location choice entails that workers\n\u201cpay\u201d for high wages through increased housing costs and/or a reduction in", "\u201cpay\u201d for high wages through increased housing costs and/or a reduction in\ndesirable locational amenities (Rosen 1979; Roback 1982).

In the extreme case, sup-\npose all jobs suddenly included a fully remote option. It would no longer be\nnecessary to reside in New York City, for example, to receive the high wage\njobs the city offers; residents of other places could access the same wages\nwithout paying for expensive housing. The situation would put upward pres-\nsure on housing prices in less expensive places and downward pressure on\nNew York real estate prices, until the difference in housing costs was small\nenough to discourage further migration.12\nMore realistically, only a minority of jobs are likely to supply a fully\nremote option, leaving most workers tied to their place of employment.", "remote option, leaving most workers tied to their place of employment.\nEconomic theory offers less dramatic predictions in this scenario. To some\n11 This statement assumes that amenities are similar across more- and less-productive places. But\nconsider a world in which locations differ in two respects: productivity and appeal (i.e., amenity\nvalue). Some places (e.g., New York City) are especially productive for businesses, and others (e.g.,\nHonolulu) are especially appealing for residence. Workers make their choice about where to live\nwhile considering wages, housing costs, and this appeal. To avoid an unrealistic situation where\nevery worker chooses to live in the same place, wages (net of housing costs) must adjust to make\nworkers indifferent about where they live\u2014if net wages were everywhere identical, all workers\nwould prefer to live in Honolulu.\n12 Brueckner, Kahn, and Lin (2023) present a formal model, building on the Rosen-Roback", "12 Brueckner, Kahn, and Lin (2023) present a formal model, building on the Rosen-Roback\nframework, for spatial equilibrium with remote work. In their model, as in this example, remote\nwork is implemented for all workers.\n102 | Chapter 2\nextent, reverse migration of non-remote workers to more-expensive places\n(due to house prices being bid up in less-expensive places by remote work-\ners) would partially offset remote worker migration. Hybrid work would\nhave smaller-scale effects than fully remote work because the workers\nwould still need to commute occasionally. Many hybrid and fully remote\nworkers would also demand larger homes, in part because remote work\nrequires home office space.\nEconomic theory therefore implies that a rise in remote work should\nlead workers to move farther from expensive cities whose chief economic\nadvantage is the availability of high-wage jobs. The migration could be a\nfew miles down the road or, in the case of fully remote workers, to some", "few miles down the road or, in the case of fully remote workers, to some\nother place entirely. Conversely, workers living outside expensive places\ndesiring jobs offered in those places could stay where they are and work\nremotely. The extent to which these dynamics are evident in available data\nis an important subject for ongoing research.\nRemote Work, Welfare, and Wages\nConsidered as a valued amenity, how much of an improvement in worker\nwelfare does remote work imply? And to what extent is this amenity value\nadded to or offset by corresponding changes in productivity and wages?\nThe most straightforward way to answer the first question is to ask\nworkers. Recent surveys exploring workers\u2019 willingness to pay for remote\nwork find that they generally value it considerably. When asked how large\na pay cut they would accept to work remotely for about half the week,\nrespondents said 5 percent to 8 percent of their pay on average (Aksoy et", "respondents said 5 percent to 8 percent of their pay on average (Aksoy et\nal. 2022; Davis 2024; Mas and Pallais 2017). And 31 percent of those cur-\nrently working at least partially remotely said they would actively seek other\nemployment\u2014or leave their job\u2014if required to return to the office full time\n(Board of Governors 2024). The averages belie substantial variation across\nworkers; early in the pandemic, nearly one fifth of workers said they would\naccept at least a 15 percent pay cut to work remotely two or three days a\nweek (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2021a).\nTo understand why workers value remote work, it is helpful to explore\nhow time allocation changes when they work remotely. Time-use data\nallow for comparisons between remote and non-remote workers, but the\ncomparisons are not apples-to-apples. Remote workers tend to have elevated\neducation levels and work the types of jobs in which virtual interaction is\nproductive.", "education levels and work the types of jobs in which virtual interaction is\nproductive.\nWhile it may not be possible to adjust for all such differences using\navailable data, the CEA adjusts for several important factors in figure 2-11\nHow Remote Work is Reshaping the Economy | 103\nFigure 2-11.

Remote workers spend less time on commuting and personal care.\nFrom the hour remote workers save across the two categories, they allocate", "From the hour remote workers save across the two categories, they allocate\nabout half to leisure and half to sleep and caregiving of children or other\nadults.16 In general, the differences in time allocation between remote and\nnon-remote workers do not change considerably when adjusting for observ-\nable differences between workers.\nIn addition to shifting the amounts of time spent on different activities,\nremote work affects when individuals work and the flexibility they have.\nDuring the pandemic, some remote workers spent increased amounts of time\nworking on weekends and outside typical weekday hours (McDermott and\nHansen 2021). Mothers working from home reported working more in the\nevenings (Pabilonia and Vernon 2023).\nHow remote work affects productivity\nIn addition to shifting how people spend their time, remote work can change\nhow productive they are while they are working. Current evidence does not\nsuggest a simple positive or negative relationship between remote work and", "suggest a simple positive or negative relationship between remote work and\nproductivity that holds across the board. In some settings, evidence points\ntoward remote work increasing productivity. Bloom et al. (2015) find that\nin a call center where workers were randomly assigned to work remotely,\nremote personnel had higher output than their in-office counterparts because\nthey worked longer hours and answered more calls per minute. At the indus-\ntry level, researchers find that total factor productivity was higher in sectors\nthat experienced larger increases in remote work (Pabilonia and Redmond\n2024), though labor productivity was not similarly associated (Fernald et\nal. 2024). Other research, such as that by Bloom, Han, and Liang (2024)\nexamining hybrid remote work, finds no effect on performance.\nStill others have found a negative effect of remote work on productiv-\nity, particularly through its effect on teamwork, collaboration, and learning.", "ity, particularly through its effect on teamwork, collaboration, and learning.\nGibbs, Mengel, and Siemroth (2024) find a decline in innovation related\nto remote work, which they explain through a decline in \u201cwatercooler\u201d\nconversations that matter for collaboration. Remote work may also lead to\na decrease in mentoring and other interactions, so even in the cases where\n15 Some research finds patterns in how time is shared across multiple activities: mothers report\nsimultaneous childcare and paid work to a greater extent than do fathers (Pabilonia and Vernon\n2023).\n16 By contrast, Bloom, Davis, and Barrero (2020) directly ask workers how they use time saved from\nreduced commuting and find that more than one third of the saved time is allocated to paid work.\nHow Remote Work is Reshaping the Economy | 105\nremote work presents short-run gains for younger workers, long-run losses\nmay emerge (Emanuel, Harrington, and Pallais 2023; Yang et al. 2022).", "may emerge (Emanuel, Harrington, and Pallais 2023; Yang et al. 2022).\nNot every association between remote work and productivity will\nhave a causal interpretation. Researchers have suggested that some of the\nmeasured productivity difference between remote and non-remote workers\ncould be due to selection: which workers choose to work remotely and how\nremote work affects an individual worker\u2019s productivity depend on how\nproductive that worker was initially (Emanuel and Harrington 2024; Atkin,\nSchoar, and Shinde 2023).\nThe available research literature indicates that the industry, the extent\nof remote work (i.e., hybrid or fully remote), the seniority of the worker, and\nthe job\u2019s context are all important determinants of effects on productivity.\nIt is intuitive that the productivity effect should differ by how well-suited\nan occupation is to being performed remotely. Given that remote work may\nnegatively impact teamwork and learning, one should expect productivity", "negatively impact teamwork and learning, one should expect productivity\nimpacts to depend on how frequently workers interact with each other.\nAdditionally, while experienced workers could be more productive work-\ning remotely, newer workers can lose out on valuable feedback (Emanuel,\nHarrington, and Pallais 2023).\nHow wages differ for remote workers\nThe relationship between remote work and wages depends on various fac-\ntors including the relative productivity of remote work, any change in match\nquality, and the amenity value to workers. To identify the combined impact,\nresearchers could in principle calculate the average wage gap between\nremote and non-remote workers after adjusting for all relevant differences in\nwhich workers and jobs tend to be remote. However, in practice it can be dif-\nficult or impossible to make all necessary adjustments using available data,\nand CEA analysis finds that remote workers continue to earn higher wages", "and CEA analysis finds that remote workers continue to earn higher wages\nafter controlling for observed characteristics. These findings are consistent\nwith other research finding higher wages for remote workers (Pabilonia and\nVernon 2024).\nAn alternative is to examine wage changes over time for specific\nworkers who experience changes in their remote work status, a methodol-\nogy which helps to adjust for persistent differences between remote and\nnon-remote workers. The CEA first examined job switchers who also\nchanged their remote work status. Movements from non-remote to hybrid\njobs, or from hybrid to fully remote jobs, tended to come with larger wage\nincreases than movements in the opposite direction. However, this pattern\nwould also be expected if remote work were disproportionately provided in\nhigher-quality jobs\u2014the pattern evident in figures 2-8 and 2-9. Turning to\njob-stayers\u2014for whom job quality seems less likely to change along with a\n106 | Chapter 2", "job-stayers\u2014for whom job quality seems less likely to change along with a\n106 | Chapter 2\nshift in remote work status\u2014the pattern is more mixed. Some remote-status\ntransitions are consistent with the existence of a compensating differential,\nbut some are not. The CEA regards this evidence as inconclusive and illus-\ntrative of the difficulty in identifying compensating differentials amidst the\nvarious ways that workers and jobs can differ (Lavetti 2023).\nOther kinds of evidence point more clearly to lower wage growth\nfor remote workers and therefore notable compensating differentials. In a\nsurvey of business executives, Barrero et al. (2022) ask about the connec-\ntion between remote work and compensation strategies. They find that, as\nof spring 2022, 38 percent of businesses report having increased remote\nwork to moderate wage growth. A similar share reported an intention to\nimplement this strategy in the coming months. Averaging across businesses", "implement this strategy in the coming months. Averaging across businesses\nthat did and did not use remote work in this way, executives believed that\u2014\nthrough deployment of remote work\u2014they had limited wage growth by\nabout 1 percentage point over the prior year.17\nAdditional research is needed to better understand how remote work\naffects wages. Because remote work is so unequally distributed, and because\nthe relationship between remote work and wages can differ over time and\nacross groups of workers, this question is especially difficult to answer.\nRemote Work and Job Access\nIn addition to affecting the welfare of workers already in the labor market,\nremote work has the potential to affect who participates in the labor force.\nDuring the Biden-Harris Administration, prime-age labor force participation\nreached a record high for women in 2024. Prime-age men\u2019s participation\nalso recovered from the pandemic, but against a backdrop of decline for", "also recovered from the pandemic, but against a backdrop of decline for\nmore than 70 years (CEA 2024b). Moreover, U.S. population aging has and\nwill continue to put downward pressure on labor force participation.\nIf remote work removes impediments to joining the workforce, it\nwill give some individuals new options and strengthen the U.S. economy.\nOne group that could gain job access includes people with disabilities. For\ndisabled workers, remote work can remove physical barriers to accessing\nthe workplace. For example, workers with mobility restrictions might ben-\nefit from wheelchair accessibility features already incorporated into their\nresidence.18\n17 Two relevant factors imply that measured wage growth could understate welfare improvements\nfor remote workers. First, any reduction in nominal wage growth could be offset by reductions in\ncost of living, if remote work allows households to locate farther from expensive places. Second,", "cost of living, if remote work allows households to locate farther from expensive places. Second,\nthe reduction in commute time implies that earnings per hour (inclusive of hours spent commuting)\nwould rise more than earnings per hour worked.\n18 Individuals with work-limiting characteristics other than disabilities could also benefit. For\nexample, working from home could allow neurodivergent workers to limit overstimulation or\nsensory overload (Doyle 2022).\nHow Remote Work is Reshaping the Economy | 107\nBeing able to work remotely also has potential benefits for those caring\nfor children or elderly parents, which can make in-office work requirements\nimpossible to satisfy. Additionally, individuals moving to take care of a\nparent or other family member could use remote work to keep their existing\njob or access other distant jobs. Given that caregiving responsibilities are not\nequally distributed across men and women, remote work could mitigate gen-", "equally distributed across men and women, remote work could mitigate gen-\nder disparities in labor force participation.19 Consistent with this hypothesis,\nincreases in sector-specific remote work are associated with a diminished\ngap in employment between mothers and other women (Harrington and\nKahn 2023).\nFinally, remote work could affect labor force accessibility not only\nthrough encouraging entry, but also by delaying exit (Liu and Quinby 2024).\nFor example, workers considering retirement or unretirement might find it\nappealing to work if remote jobs facilitated traveling while working or other\nflexible arrangements.\nTo better understand remote work\u2019s impact on labor force par-\nticipation, the CEA examines non-participating workers from October 2021\nthrough September 2023 who had obtained jobs by 12 months after first\nappearing in the CPS. Figure 2-12 shows the percentage of those individu-\nals taking remote work positions, separated by their reason for initial non-", "als taking remote work positions, separated by their reason for initial non-\nparticipation.20 Of workers who initially said they were out of the labor force\nbecause of a disability, 6 percent of those working one year later were doing\nso remotely. A comparatively large share of initially retired workers and\nthose with caregiving responsibilities took remote jobs (17 and 14 percent,\nrespectively).\nRegardless of reason, many newly employed workers from outside the\nlabor force are finding remote jobs, and in at least some cases, the individu-\nals would have not been able to work without a remote option. Additionally,\nresearch supports the hypothesis that remote work raises employment for\npeople with disabilities, despite the relatively low share of disabled workers\ntransitioning from non-participation to remote work in the CEA analysis.\nBloom, Dahl, and Rooth (2024) find that most of the recent increase in\nemployment for those with disabilities ages 18 through 64, from 31.5 per-", "employment for those with disabilities ages 18 through 64, from 31.5 per-\ncent in 2019 to 38.3 percent in 2024, can be explained by the rise of remote\nwork.\n19 As of January 2020, 14 percent of all 25- to 54-year-old women reported that caregiving\nresponsibilities were their reason for not participating in the labor force. By contrast, only 1 percent\nof 25- to 54-year-old men reported the same.\n20 Of the population not in the labor force in January 2020, 15 percent did not participate because\nthey were ill or had a disability, 13 percent did not participate due to house or family care, 48\npercent did not participate because they were retired, 20 percent did not participate because they\nwere in school, and 4 percent had other reasons for non-participation.\n108 | Chapter 2\nFigure 2-12.

By relaxing a\ngeographic constraint\u2014that workers need to live close to their employer\u2014\nremote work has potentially sweeping implications for matching and\nlocational choices. The CEA therefore examines remote work\u2019s effects on\nthe sorting of workers into jobs, mismatch and match efficiency, and match\nquality between workers and firms.\nRe-sorting in the short run\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many but not all jobs suddenly", "Re-sorting in the short run\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many but not all jobs suddenly\nbecame remote. For example, Indeed data show that communications and\nmarketing jobs became more likely to feature remote options during the\npandemic. At the same time, many job vacancies (e.g., in food preparation\nand nursing) featured little change in remote work status (Judes et al. 2021).\nWithin and across fields, workers differed in their strength of preference for\nremote work and were often ill-matched with their current job after the shift.\nThe temporary misallocation of workers across remote and non-remote jobs\nHow Remote Work is Reshaping the Economy | 109\nled to a surge in quitting and gave remote vacancies a strong recruitment\nadvantage (Bagga et al. 2024). Bagga and coauthors find that this pattern\nwas unlikely to be caused by other factors at play during the pandemic. To\nillustrate the dynamic, figure 2-13 recreates a similar figure.21", "illustrate the dynamic, figure 2-13 recreates a similar figure.21\nPanel A in the figure compares the average change in job-filling rate\n(hires per vacancy) from January 2020 to 2021 among multiple industries,\nwith each sector\u2019s remote work share shown on the horizontal axis. Job fill-\ning was substantially easier during the pandemic for industries with many\nremote jobs, as indicated by the positive slope in panel A.22\nThe pattern appears to have been temporary. By the time the shift\nto remote work had settled and the labor market began normalizing, the\njob-filling rate advantage for industries with high remote shares had mostly\ndisappeared, as shown in panel B.\nThough it is difficult to determine the current stage of the job-sorting\nprocess, one interpretation of the two panels in figure 2-13 is that because a\nvaluable amenity became widely available in some jobs but not others, the\nlabor market endured a sustained period of above-normal churn on the way", "labor market endured a sustained period of above-normal churn on the way\nto a new equilibrium. The reshuffling was largely accomplished between\n2022 and 2024.\nDiminished mismatch in the long run\nAs this effect subsides, it may be replaced by longer-run modifications that\nremote work makes to the matching process. As previously discussed, one\nimportant feature of any labor market is mismatch: the extent to which job\nseekers and job vacancies are poorly aligned across places or sectors. Over\nthe long run, remote work should diminish mismatch by breaking down\ngeographic barriers that make it difficult for job seekers to compete for\nvacancies on a level playing field.\nOne way to test this hypothesis empirically is to examine how state-\nlevel job-finding rates in the post-pandemic era have evolved relative to the\npre-pandemic era. If geographic mismatch has lessened, then job-finding\nrates should have converged across places, given that workers in areas with", "rates should have converged across places, given that workers in areas with\nlow job-finding rates now have access to job openings in places where plen-\ntiful opportunities exist.23\nFigure 2-14 shows the expected pattern.

The analysis is qualitatively similar when\nweighting industries by their January 2020 job openings share.\n23 Convergence in job-filling rates would not necessarily be expected because they depend on where\nremote vacancies are posted, which may be spatially concentrated.\n110 | Chapter 2\nFigure 2-13.

The results are similar.\n112 | Chapter 2\nThe quality of matches\nLabor market search is fundamentally about getting the right employer\nmatched with the right worker. So, how does remote work affect who is\nmatched with which firm? The answer helps indicate how remote work\naffects match quality. It is a difficult question to answer, however, because\ntwo commonly used match quality metrics\u2014wages and tenure (Belot, Liu,\nand Triantafyllou 2024)\u2014are poorly suited to understanding remote work.\nAs discussed, wages paid to remote workers may reflect a compensating\ndifferential, as well as any effects on match quality and productivity; in this\ncontext, wages are likely a poor proxy for the value of a job match. Because", "context, wages are likely a poor proxy for the value of a job match. Because\nthe rise in remote work is recent, it is difficult to determine whether specific\nremote job matches will prove lasting\u2014and, by inference, have relatively\nhigh match quality\u2014compared to non-remote jobs.\nAnother variable useful for understanding match quality is the quits\nrate. Figure 2-15 shows a negative relationship between the change in an\nindustry\u2019s quits rate (between the pre- and post-pandemic periods) and\nFigure 2-15.

Importantly, the relationship exists in the most recent\navailable data, by contrast to the job-filling pattern (shown above) which\nappears to have been temporary. This result is consistent with higher match\nquality in industries that have made wider use of remote work.\nAs discussed, a large share of those working remotely\u201431 percent of\nrespondents in the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking\n(Board of Governors 2024)\u2014report that they would actively search for a", "(Board of Governors 2024)\u2014report that they would actively search for a\nnew job if their current employer required full-time, in-person work. While\nthe finding speaks directly to the value many workers place on remote work,\nit also suggests that remote work underpins match quality for some workers.\nGeographic reallocation\nIn the past, jobs were almost always tied to particular locations. Matching\nwith an employer meant moving into reasonably close proximity and com-\nmuting regularly to a place of business. With remote work, this is no longer\nthe case. To the extent that remote work makes matching more efficient, it\nis due to relaxed geographic constraints allowing hybrid workers to move\nmoderately farther from their employers and fully remote workers to move\nanywhere.\nConsider a hybrid worker newly permitted to work from home two\ndays a week. For those with a standard workweek, the worker\u2019s weekly\ncommute time is immediately cut by 40 percent, and the cost of locating", "commute time is immediately cut by 40 percent, and the cost of locating\nslightly farther from work decreases accordingly. The long commute that\nwas not acceptable five days a week is now potentially tolerable at three\ndays a week. For a fully remote worker, the situation is more dramatically\naltered: The cost of locating farther from work is reduced to almost zero.\nHas the change in incentives affected household movement in recent\nyears, and how does it affect the distance or commute time between work-\nplaces and residences?25 Research based on U.S. credit files reveals that\nindividuals, especially high-income workers, migrated during the pandemic\nfrom high- to low-density areas (Li and Su 2023).26 City centers in large\nmetropolitan areas lost residents, while suburbs and small metro areas\ngained residents. Largely because of variation in occupational mix across\nmetropolitan areas, it was therefore partially possible to predict in advance", "metropolitan areas, it was therefore partially possible to predict in advance\nwhich places would see the most dramatic changes (Dingel and Neiman\n2020).27\n25 Another question for further research is how remote work might differentially affect dual-earner\nhouseholds. In principle, remote work should make it easier for one worker to access better job\nopportunities without requiring a partner to accept a less-desirable job.\n26 In Swedish data, researchers found that increases in commuting distance during the pandemic\ndisproportionately occurred among workers for whom remote work was more available (Nilsson et\nal. 2024).\n27 See Hansen et al.

The finding suggests\nthat the shift to remote work drew on workers whose previous commute\ntimes were spread across the distribution (i.e., both short- and long-duration\ncommutes became less common after the increase in remote work).29\nIn addition to affecting residential location patterns, remote work\nchanges demand for housing quantity.

But it does suggest that any such effect\nwas offset by the rise in share of those who usually worked from home.\nHow Remote Work is Reshaping the Economy | 115\nFigure 2-17.

Other research\nalso finds that the discount for housing positioned away from central busi-\nness districts has diminished in metropolitan areas with high remote work\npotential (Gupta et al. 2022; Brueckner, Kahn, and Lin 2023).\nTo the extent that newly remote workers tend to seek places with inex-", "To the extent that newly remote workers tend to seek places with inex-\npensive housing aligned with their preferences (rather than employer avail-\nability), this could affect recent worker mobility.

They\nare also more likely (4.2 percent) than non-remote workers (2.2 percent)\n30 However, the long-run impacts on housing prices will likely be more muted as supply has time to\nadjust in response to remote work-induced changes in demand (Howard, Liebersohn, and Ozimek\n2023).\n116 | Chapter 2\nto have moved across state lines.

Remote workers\nare disproportionately highly educated, which is itself associated with higher", "are disproportionately highly educated, which is itself associated with higher\nrates of interstate migration (Molloy, Smith, and Wozniak 2011).\nComplementary evidence is provided by Li and Su (2023), who find\nthat net in-migration has fallen dramatically in census tracts with the most\nremote jobs; remote jobs have largely stayed in the tracts, but many of the\nworkers who hold them have left the area. Similarly, Brueckner, Kahn, and\nLin (2023) use U.S. Postal Service data to demonstrate heightened popula-\ntion outflows from high-productivity places with high potential for remote\nwork.\nThe migration responses predicted by theory and observed to some\nextent by researchers have implications for the distribution of economic\nactivity, tax revenues generated by the activity, and the commercial real\nestate market in particular.

Workers are limited in how far from central business\ndistricts they can live by the costliness of any required commuting.

Similarly, commercial real estate has\nshown signs of stress in the wake of the pandemic and rise of remote work,\nwhich could have implications for both the financial markets where com-\nmercial real estate debt is traded and local public finance. Office vacancies\nrose to 20.1 percent in the third quarter of 2024, and forecasters project that\nvacancy rates could peak at 24 percent in 2026 (Moody\u2019s 2024; Metcalfe,\nSpinelli, and LaSalvia 2024). Gupta, Mittal, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2024)\nestimate that remote work could reduce commercial real estate values by", "estimate that remote work could reduce commercial real estate values by\nmore than $500 billion, though the potential to convert offices to residential\nbuildings may mitigate some of the long-run impact.31\nThe Big Picture and Public Policy\nRemote work is arguably the most consequential recent shift for U.S.\nworking arrangements and the overall labor market. Researchers are only\nbeginning to process the magnitude, durability, and impact of the changes.\nAs this chapter has shown, the benefits are potentially substantial. Most\nworkers value a remote-work option: For some, it is a source of workday\nflexibility and an avoided commute; for those with disabilities or caregiving\nresponsibilities, it can make labor force participation more feasible.\n31 Van Nieuwerburgh (2022) provides a detailed analysis and assesses relevant research on this and\nother spatial dynamics related to remote work.\nHow Remote Work is Reshaping the Economy | 117", "other spatial dynamics related to remote work.\nHow Remote Work is Reshaping the Economy | 117\nAncillary benefits like reduced commute times\u2014in turn leading to\ndecreased traffic congestion and pollution\u2014have also emerged. Stay-at-\nhome orders during the early pandemic caused substantial declines in air\npollution, with slightly larger effects in places that featured more remote\nwork (Brodeur, Cook, and Wright 2021).32\nIn the case of fully remote work, workers and firms can find each\nother when geographic distance would ordinarily make a match impossible.\nWithout having to relocate, workers and firms can adapt to changing market\nconditions by quickly forming new matches. To the extent that match quality\nimproves, both worker welfare and national productivity are enhanced.\nAs with any fundamental labor market shift, remote work also creates\npotential pitfalls. For some businesses, remote work may turn out to be\nan unacceptable productivity drag. This could be evident immediately, or", "an unacceptable productivity drag. This could be evident immediately, or\nin other cases, it could become apparent only with time, as collaboration\ndiminishes and young workers receive insufficient mentoring (Emanuel,\nHarrington, and Pallais 2023; Yang et al. 2022). The balance of benefits and\ncosts will be different for every employer and worker.\nAnother challenge appears at scale as the accumulated decisions of\nindividual employers and workers disrupt housing markets. Residential\nhousing has become increasingly expensive in some areas as demand from\nhybrid and fully remote workers surpasses supply. Conversely, demand for\ncommercial real estate has declined, which poses both risks and opportu-\nnities. As economic activity diminishes in central business districts, the\necosystems that support firms also diminish (Althoff et al. 2022), along\nwith the property tax revenue upon which some cities rely heavily (Auxier\nand Brosy 2024). On the other hand, there are opportunities: For example,", "and Brosy 2024). On the other hand, there are opportunities: For example,\nthe Administration has worked to facilitate the conversion of office space\nto multifamily housing (CEA 2023). This strategy addresses the chronic\nundersupply of residential housing and can ameliorate adverse impacts\non non-remote workers (Gupta, Martinez, and Van Nieuwerburgh 2023;\nRichard 2024).\nOther potential challenges from remote work are admittedly more\nspeculative. For example, physical workspaces develop social capital\n(Bandiera, Barankay, and Rasul 2008); it is unclear to what extent virtual\nwork interactions are a replacement. Relatedly, in largely remote work-\nplaces, organizing workers into unions could require different strategies,\ngiven the increased distance between employers and employees.\nThe allocation of remote work across the labor market depends on\npublic policy details. Remote work is not technically feasible in most\ninstances without reliable high-speed internet access (Barrero, Bloom, and", "instances without reliable high-speed internet access (Barrero, Bloom, and\n32 In China, increased remote work during the early pandemic led to large decreases in air pollution\nby reducing travel (Chen and Li 2024). However, studies that focus on travel-related pollution may\nmiss other effects like changes in home energy use.\n118 | Chapter 2\nDavis 2021b). Parts of the United States still lack such access, a condition\nthe Administration worked to address through $90 billion in federal fund-\ning to expand access to high-speed, affordable internet across the country.\nWhile Congress failed to continue funding for the Affordable Connectivity\nProgram, which provided qualifying households up to $30 per month off\ntheir internet bill, the Administration has helped more than 23 million house-\nholds save money on connectivity (White House 2024).\nLong-standing legal impediments can also shape how remote work\nplays out in the labor market. For example, occupational licensing rules are", "plays out in the labor market. For example, occupational licensing rules are\nusually set at the state level, and in a healthcare context, providers typically\nmust be licensed wherever their patients live. In a world of remote medical\nwork (i.e., telehealth), this system can be a poor fit (Scheffler 2019), limiting\nits benefits (Zeltzer et al. 2024).33\nSimilar issues are posed by state-based employer tax and employee\nbenefit systems (Aksoy et al. 2022). Remote workers located in a different\nstate than their employer potentially face double taxation, and only 16 states\nand the District of Columbia have reciprocity agreements with others to\nnavigate taxation of workers commuting across state lines, such as hybrid\nworkers with an infrequent but long commute (Peterson 2024). Employers\nmust report and pay unemployment insurance taxes in the state where a\nworker lives; setting up operations in each state and understanding appli-\ncable law variation is a significant burden (Miller 2020).", "cable law variation is a significant burden (Miller 2020).\nIn the post-pandemic world, employers and workers will need to\nmake conscious decisions about whether and how to work remotely. Some\nemployers will continue to adjust their practices, making increasing or\ndecreasing use of remote work depending on their circumstances and experi-\nences. But the intensity of worker preference for remote work and its recruit-\ning advantages are strong tailwinds. As researchers add to the understanding\nof remote work, policymakers can make evidence-based decisions about\nhow to broaden its promise while minimizing its downsides.\n33 Survey data suggest that many remote workers are affected by licensing rules. In 2023\u20132024,\nremote workers were 1.7 percentage points more likely than non-remote workers to have an\noccupational license (CPS and CEA calculations).\nHow Remote Work is Reshaping the Economy | 119\n120 | Chapter 2\nChapter 3\nAligning the International Tax System\nwith the Globalized Economy", "120 | Chapter 2\nChapter 3\nAligning the International Tax System\nwith the Globalized Economy\nCorporations that operate in more than one country generate a substantial\nshare of global economic activity.

Given the economic significance of\nmultinationals, taxation of their profits has the potential to be a major source\nof government revenue.\nHowever, prior to 2021, a lack of coordination among countries in taxing\nmultinationals led to a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in corporate income tax rates\nfrom a 40.2 percent average worldwide statutory tax rate to 23.5 percent\nover the past four decades (Enache 2023).

While many factors, including infrastructure, work-\nforce makeup, and rule of law, determine multinationals\u2019 location choices,\ncountries with relatively low corporate tax rates are generally more attrac-\ntive than others, all else being equal (Siedschlag, Zhang, and Smith 2013;\nCastellani et al. 2022; Basu, Mitra, and Purohit 2023). As a result, countries\ncompete with one another to keep tax rates low enough to retain or attract", "compete with one another to keep tax rates low enough to retain or attract\nmultinational economic activity.

Pillar\nOne, discussed in the next section of this chapter and not yet finalized,\naddresses where multinationals pay income taxes. Pillar Two, the Model\nRules of which were published in December 2021 and are being imple-\nmented by countries around the world, addresses how much multinationals\npay in income taxes (OECD 2021c).\nPillar Two aims to reduce tax competition by ensuring large multi-\nnationals pay a minimum level of tax regardless of where they operate.\nMultinationals with at least \u20ac750 million ($817 million in October 2024) in\nglobal revenues are subject to a global 15 percent minimum tax, effectively\nincreasing taxes on multinationals with income in low-tax countries (OECD\n2022).

The\nmechanisms also incentivize countries to participate in Pillar Two. The first\n132 | Chapter 3\nFigure 3-8.

The Income Inclusion Rule reduces incentives for multinationals\nheadquartered in countries with such a rule to offshore income to low-tax\ncountries.\nFor example, suppose the United States implements an Income\nInclusion Rule and a U.S. multinational has three subsidiaries: the high-tax\nsubsidiary has an effective tax rate of 25 percent, the mid-tax subsidiary has\nan effective tax rate of 12 percent, and the low-tax subsidiary has an effec-\ntive tax rate of 0 percent.

Under the Income Inclusion Rule,\nthe United States collects the extra tax revenue represented by the teal area.10\nThe second mechanism is the Undertaxed Payments Rule (OECD\n2020). The rule is applied to subsidiaries of multinationals headquartered in\nhigh-tax countries that do not implement an Income Inclusion Rule.11 The\nUndertaxed Payments Rule incentivizes countries to participate in Pillar\nTwo because if they fail to do so, they sacrifice revenue to other countries.", "Two because if they fail to do so, they sacrifice revenue to other countries.\nCountries with the Undertaxed Payments Rule can disallow deductions\nfor subsidiaries located within their borders if any other entities of the\nsame multinational group pay an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent.\nThe rule effectively allows countries who have signed on to Pillar Two\nto ensure that any multinationals with subsidiaries operating within their\nborders pay a global minimum tax of 15 percent, regardless of where the\nparent company is located. Notably, the Income Inclusion Rule has priority\nover the Undertaxed Payments Rule; that is, the latter cannot be applied to\nmultinationals headquartered in countries that have implemented an Income\nInclusion Rule (OECD 2020).\nContinuing the previous example, suppose the United States does not\nimplement an Income Inclusion Rule but the high-tax subsidiary country\nimplements an Undertaxed Payments Rule.

The Undertaxed Payments Rule\nallows the high-tax subsidiary country to collect the extra tax revenue repre-\nsented by the teal area in figure 3-8.\nThe third mechanism is the Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax,\nwhich addresses situations where a country\u2019s tax rate falls below the global\nminimum tax rate (OECD 2023c). In this case, the country can apply its own\ntop-up tax to ensure that large multinationals operating within its borders\npay at least the global minimum tax rate. Adoption of a Qualified Domestic\nMinimum Top-up Tax is voluntary but self-reinforcing: If a country with a\ntax rate below 15 percent does not impose a Qualified Domestic Minimum\nTop-up Tax and a multinational subsidiary in the country pays an effective\ntax rate below 15 percent, other countries will be able to collect the top-up\ntax via the Income Inclusion Rule or Undertaxed Payments Rule. In other\nwords, the low-tax country sacrifices tax revenue to another country and", "words, the low-tax country sacrifices tax revenue to another country and\n10 The U.S. GILTI regime in its current form does not qualify as an Income Inclusion Rule because\nthe effective GILTI tax rate is less than 15 percent and the tax is calculated on a global basis rather\nthan a country-by-country basis. Levying a minimum tax on a global basis enables multinationals\nto pay less than 15 percent tax in low-tax countries because tax rates are averaged across high- and\nlow-tax non-U.S. countries in which they operate. Further, some design features of the GILTI regime\ncreate incentives for U.S. multinationals to shift income outside of the United States (Treasury\n2024).\n11 The OECD established a transitional safe harbor where no tax will be payable under the\nUndertaxed Payments Rule for any undertaxed income of a multinational in its ultimate parent entity\ncountry if that country applies a corporate income tax rate of at least 20 percent (OECD 2023b).

The first term in parentheses is the\ncorporate tax rate set by Country A, and the second term in parentheses is the corporate tax\nrate set by Country B. This example assumes that total economic activity is held constant,\nmeaning multinationals can only change the allocation of economic activity across countries,\nmultinationals report income where their economic activity is located, and total taxable", "multinationals report income where their economic activity is located, and total taxable\nincome equals $100.\n2025 Economic Report of the President\nwould be better off enacting a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax\nto collect the tax revenue. Consistent with this incentive, multiple low-tax\ncountries have announced their intention to impose a Qualified Domestic\nMinimum Top-up Tax, and Bermuda has increased its statutory corporate\ntax rate from 0 percent to 15 percent (Sullivan 2023; PwC 2024a).\nBuilding on the ongoing example, if the mid-tax subsidiary country\nand the low-tax subsidiary country do not want to forgo revenue, they can\ncollect the tax revenue represented by their respective teal areas by enacting\na Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax.\nThus, the proposition that Pillar Two lays out to countries is quite\nsimple: As long as at least one country involved implements one of the Pillar\nTwo provisions, the tax revenue up to a 15 percent effective tax rate (repre-", "Two provisions, the tax revenue up to a 15 percent effective tax rate (repre-\nsented by the teal area in figure 3-8) is available for collection. Countries can\nAligning the International Tax System with the Globalized Economy | 135\neither adopt one or more of the Pillar Two provisions and collect their share\nor allow other countries to collect the additional tax revenue.\nRevisiting the two-country prisoner\u2019s dilemma example, Pillar Two\nrestructures the payoffs such that each country\u2019s best option is to cooperate.\nFigure 3-9 shows the adjusted payoffs. As before, if both countries have a\ncorporate tax rate of 15 percent, as described in scenario 1, multinationals\nchoosing whether to locate economic activity in Country A or Country B\nwill be indifferent between them, so both countries will collect $7.50 in tax\nrevenue ($50 in taxable income per country multiplied by 15 percent).\nThe innovation of Pillar Two is that the three mechanisms collectively", "The innovation of Pillar Two is that the three mechanisms collectively\nmake multinationals indifferent between Countries A and B, even if one\nof them chooses to lower their tax rate, because multinationals will pay 15\npercent tax regardless. Pillar Two therefore removes countries\u2019 incentives to\nlower their corporate tax rates. Consider scenario 2 of figure 3-9. If Country\nA reduces its tax rate to 10 percent and therefore does not participate in\nPillar Two, it will collect only $5 in tax revenues on the $50 of income\nwithin its borders. This is because the Pillar Two provisions enable Country\nB to collect extra taxes so that multinationals still pay an effective rate of\n15 percent on Country A income. Country A collects 10 percent on the $50\nearned within its borders, while Country B collects 15 percent on the $50\nearned within its borders plus 5 percent on the $50 earned in Country A.\nCountry A only collects $5, while Country B collects $10. Neither country", "Country A only collects $5, while Country B collects $10. Neither country\nhas an incentive to defect from the agreement represented by scenario 1 of\nfigure 3-9 and should therefore cooperate. This is in contrast with the pre-\nPillar Two payoff structure, where both countries could earn higher payoffs\nby lowering their corporate tax rate relative to the other country.\nOverall, Pillar Two overcomes the prisoner\u2019s dilemma by eliminating\na country\u2019s incentive to reduce its corporate tax rate below 15 percent.12\nIn doing so, it protects future global corporate tax revenues by curbing\ntax competition. This is particularly important given the fiscal challenges\nfacing countries around the world (Dabla-Norris, Di Gregorio, and Cao\n2024). However, its ultimate success depends on countries enacting legisla-\ntion to incorporate Pillar Two into their national laws. The Organisation\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development published the Model Rules", "for Economic Co-operation and Development published the Model Rules\nin December 2021 (OECD 2021c). As of September 2024, 31 countries,\nincluding most EU members, Canada, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, New\nZealand, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom,\nand Vietnam, have enacted legislation to incorporate Pillar Two (PwC\n2024b).

Under a traditional tax system, the\nUnited States has taxing rights because the multinational physically operates\nin the United States and does not have a physical presence in Canada.\nTo provide perspective on the magnitude of cross-border digital ser-\nvices activity, figure 3-10 shows that the share of U.S. trade involving digital\nservices has increased from 14 percent to 21 percent of exports and from\n6 percent to roughly 9 percent of imports over the past two decades. The\ngrowth in digital services has exacerbated the tension between traditional\ntax systems and the global nature of multinationals.\nIn response to the rise of digital services activity, some countries have\nunilaterally attempted to levy taxes on revenue multinationals generate from\ncustomers within their borders (KPMG 2024). Often referred to as digital\nservices taxes, they are grounded in part on the claim that users create value", "services taxes, they are grounded in part on the claim that users create value\nfor digital services companies, and these companies therefore do not pay\nenough tax in the countries where those users are located (Stotzky and Fano\n2023). Generally, countries impose the taxes on large multinationals based\non total revenue associated with specific digital services (e.g., advertising,\nonline marketplaces, cloud services, social networks, and online dating).\nTo illustrate the prevalence of digital services taxes, table 3-1 pro-\nvides a timeline of implementation around the world. In addition to the 16\ncountries listed in the figure, other countries have announced intentions to\nimplement a digital services tax.\nA country-by-country approach to taxing digital services is problem-\natic for at least three reasons. First, unilateral digital services taxes may pose\npotential barriers to international trade to the extent they disproportionately", "potential barriers to international trade to the extent they disproportionately\nburden or restrict the economic activities of the implementing country\u2019s\n138 | Chapter 3\ntrading partners. One approach that could be considered discriminatory\nis when a country sets a revenue threshold on its digital services tax such\nthat foreign multinationals are disproportionately impacted by the tax and\ndomestic multinationals are disproportionately excluded from it. Foreign\nmultinationals subject to discriminatory digital services taxes may then be\nforced to compete on unfair terms. The discrimination concern is especially\npronounced for U.S. multinationals because they represent a plurality of the\nlargest global digital companies (Forbes 2024).\nSecond, as discussed in Hines (2023), countries acting unilaterally\nhave incentives to impose excessively high tax rates on digital multination-\nals because the costs of higher taxes (i.e., reduced economic activity) are", "als because the costs of higher taxes (i.e., reduced economic activity) are\nborne by all countries in which the digital multinationals have users. For\nexample, imagine a European country levies a tax on the digital services\nrevenue of a U.S. multinational providing a search engine. Because the tax\nreduces the multinational\u2019s after-tax profits, the multinational could respond\nby reducing economic output, such as reducing the quality of its search\nengine. The reduced search quality would be borne by all of the multina-\ntional\u2019s worldwide consumers, not just those in the European country. Thus,\nbecause the European country collects all the tax revenue generated by its\nconsumer activity but bears only a portion of reduced worldwide economic\nactivity, the European country is incentivized to impose inefficiently high\ntax rates on digital services activity. Indeed, all countries where the U.S.\nmultinational has users have the same incentive to impose significant taxes.", "multinational has users have the same incentive to impose significant taxes.\nThis ultimately can result in a reduction of economic activity, which erodes\nthe global tax base.13 These incentives underscore the need for a cooperative\napproach to taxing digital services activity.\nThird, when digital services are taxed unilaterally, countries do not\ncoordinate to ensure that the same revenues are not subject to multiple layers\nof taxation. In other words, without a coordinated method of apportioning the\nrevenues, the multinational can end up paying multiple layers of tax on the\nsame advertising revenues. Further, because digital services taxes are levied\non revenues rather than profit (revenues minus expenses), the multinational\ncould face digital services taxes, and potentially multiple layers of digital\nservices taxes, even if it is not profitable. For example, a multinational that\nearns revenues of $1 million and incurs expenses of $1.5 million reports net", "earns revenues of $1 million and incurs expenses of $1.5 million reports net\nlosses of $500,000. If a digital services tax is levied on the multinational\u2019s\nrevenues rather than its profit, the multinational might not have the where-\nwithal to pay the tax because its expenses exceed its revenues.\nGiven the concerns with a unilateral approach to cross-border digital\nservices taxation, Pillar One of the Global Tax Deal would replace the\n13 It is also important to consider the economic incidence of digital services taxes.

Pillar One\ndeems the first 10 percent as routine and the associated taxing rights would\ntherefore not be reallocated from the multinational\u2019s home country to market\ncountries.

As noted previously, multinationals\nsometimes manipulate transfer prices on transactions between affiliates to shift income between\ncountries. This leads to a corresponding shift of the tax base between countries. Wholesale\ndistribution transactions are extremely common within multinational groups and are relatively easy", "distribution transactions are extremely common within multinational groups and are relatively easy\nto price. However, despite their frequent nature and the ease of pricing them, these transactions are\nnotorious for generating costly disputes, not only between taxpayers and tax administrations, but\nalso between tax administrations (Sutton 2024).

The United States has\nstrong reasons to enact such legislation, including potential revenue genera-\ntion and more efficient allocation of economic resources.\nPotential Revenue Generation\nThe global race to the bottom and the rise of cross-border tax planning have\ncontributed to growing budget deficits. The Congressional Budget Office\nprojects that the U.S. national deficit will rise to a peak of 7.1 percent of\nGDP in 2033 as the aging population increases Social Security and Medicare\nspending and revenues do not keep pace (CBO 2024b).

The Global Tax Deal levels the playing field for domestic U.S.\nbusinesses by disincentivizing cross-border tax planning. In doing so, the\ndeal also encourages businesses to allocate capital based on workforce talent\nand market factors instead of tax minimization strategies.\nThe revenue thresholds for digital services taxes generally result in\nthe taxes being applied to large multinationals, which are disproportionately\nbased in the United States.

What is the rationale for many of these interven-\ntions and expenditures, and why has the Biden-Harris Administration taken\nextensive action to ensure more Americans than ever before can access\nhealth insurance?\nEconomists have long understood that private health insurance markets can\nmalfunction on their own and, as a result, leave many people without afford-\nable coverage options (Mankiw 2017). Health insurance works by pooling", "able coverage options (Mankiw 2017). Health insurance works by pooling\nrisk among a group of people and collecting an upfront fee (i.e., premium) to\ncover the expected costs of their healthcare.

Because health costs can be predicted to some extent by both\nthe individuals and entities bearing the risk, insurance pools must include\npeople with differing levels of risk (CRS 2023a). For this reason, every high-\nincome country in the world other than the United States either provides\nor mandates universal health insurance coverage to encourage broad risk\npooling (Schneider et al. 2021).\n145\nThe United States has taken an approach centered around employer-based\ninsurance coverage, with approximately 54 percent of people receiving\nindividual- or family-level coverage through an employer at any point\nduring the year (Keisler-Starkey and Bunch 2024).

One of the Oregon lottery analyses found sig-\nnificant improvements in self-reported health measures among those gain-\ning Medicaid coverage (Finkelstein et al. 2012), a similar finding to that of\nmany ACA insurance expansion studies (Soni, Wherry, and Simon 2020).\nWhile studies of the Oregon lottery did not detect overall changes in physi-\ncal health measures (Baicker et al. 2013), a recent re-analysis found that\npeople with little prior healthcare use who gained Medicaid experienced an", "people with little prior healthcare use who gained Medicaid experienced an\nimprovement in blood pressure (Inoue et al. 2024).

Finally, there is evidence that Medicare coverage reduces mortality\namong elderly patients hospitalized with serious illnesses (Card, Dobkin,\nand Maestas 2009).\nGrowing evidence also suggests that, in addition to having short-term\neffects on health outcomes, access to health insurance has the potential to\nimprove long-term health trajectories. Using quasi-experimental research\ndesigns exploiting variation in childhood exposure to Medicaid across\ncohorts or geographic areas to identify long-term effects, researchers have\nfound evidence of improved self-reported health at later ages (Currie,\nDecker, and Lin 2008), reduced chronic diseases and related hospitalizations\n(Boudreaux, Golberstein, and McAlpine 2016; Thompson 2017; Wherry\net al. 2018; Miller and Wherry 2019), reductions in disability (Goodman-\nBacon 2021), and reduced mortality later in life (Wherry and Meyer 2016;\nSohn 2017; Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie 2020; Goodman-Bacon 2021).", "Sohn 2017; Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie 2020; Goodman-Bacon 2021).\nHealth insurance coverage can also impact the health of future genera-\ntions of Americans.

One review concludes that ACA insurance expansions did not\nhave major impacts on employment, hours worked, or wages (Gruber and\nSommers 2019).

In the\nprogram\u2019s first year, 8.0 million people enrolled in private coverage through\nthe Marketplace during the annual open enrollment period. The number\njumped to 11.7 million in 2015 and grew further to 12.7 million in 2016\n(see figure 4-2). The majority of people who enrolled in the Marketplace\nreceived financial assistance in these years: In 2016, 83 percent of enrollees\nqualified for premium tax credits to help with the purchase of Marketplace\ncoverage (ASPE 2016). Research shows that previously uninsured adults\nwho gained access to subsidized Marketplace coverage experienced a\ndecrease in barriers to medical care and increased their use of outpatient\nservices and prescription drugs (Goldman et al. 2018). The premium sub-\nsidies, along with additional cost-sharing reductions provided by the ACA,", "sidies, along with additional cost-sharing reductions provided by the ACA,\nwere associated with a 17 percent reduction in out-of-pocket spending and\n30 percent reduced likelihood of catastrophic health expenditures for low-\nincome individuals (Liu et al. 2021).\nFollowing the initial Marketplace enrollment growth, fewer people\nenrolled between 2017 and 2020, possibly related to efforts under the Trump\nAdministration to undermine the ACA. In 2018, one in three non-elderly\npeople who were uninsured were eligible for free or subsidized coverage in\nthe ACA Marketplace (Cox and McDermott 2020), suggesting that many\npeople may be unaware of the option or unable to access it. Enrollment\nthrough the ACA Marketplace is typically limited to an annual open enroll-\nment period, with the exception of certain qualifying life events. Designed to\nprevent people from signing up only when they need expensive healthcare,\nopen enrollment periods can limit coverage opportunities for other individu-", "open enrollment periods can limit coverage opportunities for other individu-\nals, particularly if they are not well advertised or understood. Changes dur-\ning the Trump Administration to shorten the annual open enrollment period\nfrom 12 to 6 weeks and cut funding for marketing and enrollment assistance\nlikely exacerbated barriers (Lueck 2021; Pollitz and Amin 2021). In addi-\ntion, the individual mandate component of the ACA was removed in 2019,\nlikely having an effect on Marketplace enrollment (Fiedler 2020).\nFinally, Marketplace insurance affordability remained an issue for\nfamilies despite government subsidies to help purchase coverage. Prior to\nthe Biden-Harris Administration, families with incomes below 400 percent\nof the federal poverty level (FPL) still faced expected premium contributions\nof between 2 percent and 10 percent of their income on a sliding scale, while\nfamilies above 400 percent FPL had no cap on the percent of their income", "families above 400 percent FPL had no cap on the percent of their income\nthey may need to spend on premiums, a significant burden for people in\ntheir 50s and 60s (Banthin et al. 2024; Banthin, Skopec, and Simpson 2024).\nExpanding and Strengthening U.S. Health Insurance Coverage | 153\nExpansion in Premium Tax Credits\nThe Biden-Harris Administration implemented several important policies\nto expand access to ACA Marketplace coverage and address affordabil-\nity issues, leading to unprecedented growth in Marketplace enrollment.\nOne major initiative expanded federal financial assistance to purchase\nMarketplace insurance. Initially, individuals with incomes between 100 per-\ncent and 400 percent FPL and no other source of affordable coverage were\neligible for premium tax credits toward the purchase of Marketplace cover-\nage. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) increased the credit\namount for those who already qualified for assistance. It also expanded", "amount for those who already qualified for assistance. It also expanded\neligibility to people with incomes above 400 percent FPL for the first time,\nimplementing a cap on expected maximum premium contributions of 8.5\npercent of income for these households (Congress 2021). The changes\nlowered premiums net of the premium tax credit (i.e., net premiums) for\nmost individuals and families, helping more people to enroll in coverage\n(Ortaliza et al. 2024). While originally slated for two years of availability,\nthe expanded premium tax credits were extended through 2025 under the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) (Congress 2022a).\nThe expanded premium tax credits reduced net premiums for millions\nof Americans, saving them an average of over $800 annually (CMS 2023a).\nIndividuals and families with incomes just above the Medicaid eligibility\nthreshold (i.e., between 138 percent and 150 percent FPL), or residing in\nstates not implementing the ACA Medicaid expansions and having incomes", "states not implementing the ACA Medicaid expansions and having incomes\nbetween 100 percent and 138 percent FPL, saw their maximum required\npremium contribution decrease to 0 percent of income under the expanded\npremium tax credits, down from roughly 2 percent to 4 percent of income\n(Banthin et al. 2024). As shown in figure 4-3, Marketplace enrollment\nnearly doubled for households with incomes between 100 percent and 150\npercent FPL between 2020 and 2023. A noticeable, though less pronounced,\nincrease is evident for the \u201cother\u201d group, which includes enrollees with\nhousehold incomes above 400 percent FPL.\nFigure 4-3 also shows a large bump in enrollment in 2024 for the 100\u2013\n150 percent FPL group, as well as smaller increases for the 150\u2013200 percent\nand 200\u2013250 percent FPL groups.

While premium\nsubsidies are calculated based on the cost of Silver plans, some consumers\nchoose to use the increased subsidies to purchase plans with better levels\nof coverage. In addition, for people with incomes less than 250 percent\nFPL qualifying for additional cost-sharing reductions on Silver plans, the\nexpanded premium tax credits decreased the cost of the plans, yielding\neither zero or low premiums (Congress 2021).

The Congressional Budget\nOffice and Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that, on average each year,\n3.4 million additional people will have health insurance from 2025 to 2034 if\nthe premium tax credit expansion is made permanent (CBO 2024).\n156 | Chapter 4\nBeyond Tax Credits: Federal Actions Expanding Marketplace\nEnrollment\nAdditional federal actions have contributed to the historic Marketplace\nenrollment growth in recent years. To address the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic and allow people to access the expanded financial assistance", "pandemic and allow people to access the expanded financial assistance\nmade available in early 2021, a special open enrollment period was cre-\nated from February 15 to August 15 in 2021, during which more than 2.8\nmillion people signed up for ACA Marketplace coverage (Branham et al.\n2022). In addition, the Biden-Harris Administration in 2021 reversed policy\nchanges implemented under the Trump Administration, including extend-\ning the annual open enrollment period to 10 weeks and increasing funding\nfor advertising and enrollment assistance (Treasury and HHS 2021; HHS\n2022a).\nOther changes expanded enrollment opportunities for low-income\nindividuals and simplified the transition to Marketplace coverage during\nthe end of pandemic-related Medicaid coverage. Starting in 2022, the\nadministration created a special enrollment period for people with incomes\nunder 150 percent FPL, allowing them to enroll in Marketplace coverage", "under 150 percent FPL, allowing them to enroll in Marketplace coverage\nyear round (HHS 2022b).2 Originally specified to coincide only with the\nexpanded premium tax credits, the special enrollment period was made\npermanent in 2024, meaning it will remain available even if the expanded\nsubsidies expire in 2025 (Treasury and HHS 2024). To reduce the potential\nnegative effects of the end of Medicaid\u2019s pandemic-related continuous\ncoverage provision in 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration created a\ntemporary special enrollment period for individuals and their families who\nlost Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage\n(CMS 2024b). While the loss of Medicaid or CHIP coverage is a qualifying\nlife event already allowing for Marketplace enrollment, the standard rules\nrequire that enrollment occur within 60 days of the loss. The special enroll-\nment period relaxes the time constraint. The Administration also engaged", "ment period relaxes the time constraint. The Administration also engaged\nin outreach efforts to help people make transitions from Medicaid to ACA\nMarketplace coverage (CMS 2023b).\nFurther, the Biden-Harris Administration revised a prior interpretation\nof family eligibility rules for premium tax credits, which often prevented\nthe families of low-wage employees from receiving assistance. Previously,\nthe so-called family glitch did not allow families to qualify for premium tax\ncredits if the employed members had access to affordable individual cover-\nage through their employer, even if the available family coverage option was\nunaffordable (Keith 2022). Beginning in 2023, the Administration revised\nthe eligibility rules to fix the glitch (HHS 2022c).\n2 The change went into effect in 2022 for low-income individuals in states with Marketplaces on\nHealthCare.gov and was made optional for states operating Marketplaces on their own platforms.", "HealthCare.gov and was made optional for states operating Marketplaces on their own platforms.\nExpanding and Strengthening U.S. Health Insurance Coverage | 157\nEffective in November 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration extended\neligibility for Marketplace plans to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival\n(DACA) recipients, as well as eligibility for financial assistance if they meet\nthe other qualifying criteria. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\n(CMS) estimate that this change could lead to 100,000 previously uninsured\nDACA recipients newly enrolling in health coverage (CMS 2024c).3\nFinally, the Biden-Harris Administration took deliberate steps to\nfurther strengthen the Marketplace by protecting consumers from so-called\njunk health plans, which emerged following a rollback of federal regulations\nunder the Trump Administration. Short-term, limited-duration insurance\nplans (STLDI), commonly known as junk plans, were designed to fill tem-", "plans (STLDI), commonly known as junk plans, were designed to fill tem-\nporary gaps in coverage, but a 2018 regulation extended their duration from\n90 days to almost a year, renewable for up to three years. Junk plans could\nuse consumers\u2019 medical histories to raise their premiums or deny them cov-\nerage (Pollitz et al. 2018). The plans did not need to adhere to ACA plans\u2019\nminimum coverage requirements and threatened to attract individuals with\nlow health risks away from the Marketplace, thereby potentially impacting\nthe Marketplace risk pool and leading to elevated premiums (Young 2020).\nIn addition, a number of high-profile instances highlighted how consumers\nwere misled into thinking they were purchasing comprehensive coverage,\nthen were surprised by thousands of dollars in medical bills (Gantz 2019;\nLevey 2019; Avila 2019). In response, the Biden-Harris Administration\nlimited STLDI plans to four months, capping the length of plans advertised", "limited STLDI plans to four months, capping the length of plans advertised\nas \u201cshort-term,\u201d and required plans to disclose their coverage limitations\n(White House 2024b). These changes went into effect for plans sold on or\nafter September 1, 2024.\nThe changes during the Biden-Harris Administration have both\nexpanded and strengthened the ACA Marketplace. The Administration\u2019s\npolicies have not only increased enrollment, but they have also likely\nimproved the risk pool by attracting young people, who tend to have lower\nhealth risks, on average, than older adults, to enroll in Marketplace cover-\nage.4 In addition, the growth in Marketplace enrollment is expected to bring\nstability to the private insurance market for individuals and families and\nencourage competition among insurers (Banthin et al. 2024).

While Medicaid is the nation\u2019s public health insurance\nprogram for low-income individuals, eligibility rules prior to the ACA were", "program for low-income individuals, eligibility rules prior to the ACA were\nrestrictive and generally excluded childless adults and many low-income par-\nents (MACPAC 2021a). Since 2010, 40 states and D.C. expanded Medicaid\nto non-elderly adults with incomes up to 138 percent FPL; four states have\nexpanded Medicaid since President Biden took office (KFF 2024a). In\nnon-expansion states, most childless adults and low-income parents with\nincomes below 138 percent FPL remain ineligible for Medicaid.5 Because\nof the way ACA changes were implemented, individuals in non-expansion\nstates with incomes below 100 percent FPL do not qualify for subsidized\nMarketplace coverage (CRS 2021). This creates a gap in affordable cover-\nage options. People in this coverage gap are primarily located in southern\nstates and disproportionately Black and Hispanic (Drake et al. 2024).\nEven for eligible individuals, Medicaid enrollment can be unstable.", "Even for eligible individuals, Medicaid enrollment can be unstable.\nResearch indicates that approximately 20 percent of people with Medicaid\nor Marketplace coverage are at risk of losing insurance coverage at some\npoint over a two-year period, as compared to just 8.5 percent of those with\nemployer-based coverage (Einav and Finkelstein 2023). In addition, about\n8 percent of Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries disenroll and re-enroll in\nthe program within a year (MACPAC 2021b). While some of this churn\nresults from changes in eligibility (e.g., short-term income fluctuations), it\nalso likely reflects administrative or informational barriers related to state\neligibility redeterminations. Not only does churn create administrative costs\n(Sugar et al. 2021), but disruptions in coverage may prevent people from\nreceiving necessary healthcare and lead to prolonged uninsurance (Einav\nand Finkelstein 2023).

While states were barred from disenrolling most\npeople from Medicaid in exchange for enhanced federal funding during the\nCOVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), the provision expired in March\n2023, requiring states to redetermine eligibility for Medicaid recipients\n(CMS 2023c).\nThe Biden-Harris Administration therefore implemented a number\nof policies to strengthen Medicaid by facilitating expansions in eligibility,\npromoting continuity of coverage at the end of the COVID-19 PHE, offering\n12-month continuous eligibility to certain vulnerable population groups like\nchildren and postpartum individuals, and reducing administrative barriers to\nenrollment.\n5 The median Medicaid income eligibility threshold for non-disabled parents in the non-expansion\nstates for a family of three is 34 percent FPL (or $8,779) as of May 2024, while non-disabled adults\nwithout children only qualify for Medicaid in one of 10 states (KFF 2024b; Wisconsin DHS 2024).", "without children only qualify for Medicaid in one of 10 states (KFF 2024b; Wisconsin DHS 2024).\nExpanding and Strengthening U.S. Health Insurance Coverage | 159\nExpanding Medicaid Coverage\nTo close the Medicaid coverage gap, the ARPA offered additional federal\nmatching funds to states that had yet to expand Medicaid eligibility.\nSpecifically, it provided a two-year, 5 percentage point increase in federal\ncontribution to non-expansion Medicaid costs for any states newly expanding\ntheir Medicaid program (CRS 2021). Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma,\nand South Dakota received the ARPA increase for Medicaid expansion. As\na result, an estimated 1.1 million adults became newly eligible for Medicaid\ncoverage.6 Numerous studies show that previous ACA Medicaid expansions\nwere linked to significant coverage gains, narrowed racial gaps in healthcare\naccess, increased use of healthcare among low-income individuals, and\nimproved health outcomes (Guth, Garfield, and Rudowitz 2020).", "improved health outcomes (Guth, Garfield, and Rudowitz 2020).\nThe ARPA also provided the option for states to extend postpartum\nMedicaid coverage, an important step toward reducing the United States\u2019\nhigh rate of preventable maternal mortality, which disproportionately affects\nBlack, American Indian, and Alaska Native women (Hill et al. 2024). One\nin three pregnancy-related deaths occurs between one week and one year\npostpartum (Petersen et al. 2019). Before 2021, most individuals eligible for\nMedicaid because of pregnancy received only 60 days of postpartum cover-\nage. Eligibility after 60 days often depended on state eligibility rules for\nparents, which were less generous than eligibility rules for pregnant people,\nparticularly in non-ACA expansion states (Ranji et al. 2022).7 Prior to the\npolicy change, more than 20 percent of individuals with pregnancy cover-\nage through Medicaid, which covers 41 percent of all births (KFF 2024d),", "age through Medicaid, which covers 41 percent of all births (KFF 2024d),\nbecame uninsured between two and six months postpartum (Johnston et al.\n2021).

The ARPA temporar-\nily allowed states to extend coverage to 12 months postpartum, and the\noption was made permanent by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023\n(Congress 2022b). To date, 46 states, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands have\nadopted Medicaid postpartum coverage extensions, with two more states\nplanning to implement extensions (KFF 2024e).

Impacts on maternal\nhealth are difficult to measure, perhaps accounting for the literature\u2019s mixed\nfindings, with no change observed in maternal morbidity (Chatterji et al.\n2023) but evidence of a decline in maternal mortality (Eliason 2020).\nAn additional Biden-Harris Administration Medicaid policy tar-\ngeted children.

To strengthen Medicaid coverage for young people, the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 mandated that states provide 12\nmonths of continuous eligibility for children under the age of 19 enrolled in\nMedicaid and CHIP starting on January 1, 2024 (CMS 2024e).8 States typi-\ncally renew coverage for children once a year, but the policy prevents states\nfrom disenrolling children if they experience an otherwise-disqualifying\nchange in circumstances before the renewal period (e.g., a fluctuation in\nhousehold income, which is more common among low-income households;\nsee Gennetian et al. 2019). Prior to the policy change, about half of states\nexercised the available option of providing 12-month continuous eligibility\nfor children (Brooks and Whitener 2023).

States typically redetermine eligibility for\nMedicaid on an annual basis and disenroll anyone who is no longer eligible\nfor coverage or who fails to submit paperwork.

Not only did states face challenges related to the large volume of\nredeterminations, but they also encountered issues related to sufficient staff-\ning and the capability of existing eligibility systems (GAO 2024). Further,\ndisenrollment was expected to include people potentially still eligible for\nMedicaid but losing coverage for procedural reasons, such as if a state was\nunable to reach the enrollee for the necessary information to determine\neligibility or if the individual did not complete the needed paperwork. The\noccurrences were expected to be more prevalent during the unwinding", "occurrences were expected to be more prevalent during the unwinding\nperiod, given the time elapsed since the last eligibility renewal for many\nenrollees.9 Not only would erroneous disenrollment, which required restor-\ning enrollment for eligible individuals, result in additional administrative\ncosts, but the periods without coverage would likely hinder and delay access\nto necessary medical care (Sugar et al. 2021).\nThe Biden-Harris Administration aimed to facilitate the redetermina-\ntion process for states while preventing coverage loss among eligible benefi-\nciaries. First, states were given 12 to 14 months to restore normal eligibility\nand enrollment, but were granted flexibility regarding when to begin the\nprocess and how to prioritize enrollee population groups (CMS 2023d;\nCMS 2023e).

The only exception is North Carolina, which\nadopted a permanent Medicaid expansion during the time period (NCDHHS\n2024). However, the magnitude of disenrollment shows noticeable varia-\ntion depending on state policy choices; CMS notes that state uptake of the\navailable flexibilities and adoption of Medicaid expansions had a significant\nimpact on successful eligibility renewals (CMS 2023h). For example, figure\n4-5 shows the percent change in Medicaid enrollment from March 2023 (the\nmonth prior to the start of unwinding) to June 2024 by state ACA Medicaid\nexpansion status, excluding any states that expanded during this period.\nStates without ACA Medicaid expansions saw the largest average decrease\nin total enrollment over the period, at 23.1 percent, compared to 13.4 percent\nin ACA expansion states.

During the unwinding,\nCMS and states worked in partnership to identify and resolve areas where\nstates were not meeting federal eligibility redetermination requirements\n(GAO 2024).

Medicare Part C (i.e.,\nMedicare Advantage) was enacted in 1997 as an alternative choice offering\nboth Part A and B types of care through private insurance companies (CMS\n2024j). Part D provides prescription drug benefits either through enroll-\nment in a separate plan or as part of Medicare Advantage. Participation in\nMedicare Part D has grown over time; as of May 2024, more than 80 percent", "Medicare Part D has grown over time; as of May 2024, more than 80 percent\nof the 67.5 million program enrollees held Part D coverage (CMS 2024k).\nWhile Part D led to a substantial reduction in out-of-pocket spending\nfor prescription drugs (Engelhardt and Gruber 2011), the benefit\u2019s design\nleft many people vulnerable to high expenses. In particular, Medicare Part D\nhad a coverage gap, or \u201cdonut hole,\u201d where Medicare paid 0 percent of costs\nfor some people with a certain amount of drug expenditures (CMS n.d.). In\naddition, Part D enrollees had no out-of-pocket spending cap (Cubanski,\nNeuman, and Freed 2023). The coverage gap and lack of a spending cap\nare notable given the high price of prescription drugs in the United States\ncompared to other countries; across all drugs, U.S. prices are nearly three\ntimes higher than those of other countries, and for brand name drugs, prices\nare more than four times higher (Mulcahy, Schwam, and Lovejoy 2024).", "are more than four times higher (Mulcahy, Schwam, and Lovejoy 2024).\nThese two features left beneficiaries taking expensive prescription drugs,\nor with many prescriptions, responsible for high out-of-pocket drug costs.\nDespite reforms under the ACA and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 to phase\nout the coverage gap, the number of Part D beneficiaries responsible for high\nout-of-pocket spending would likely grow over time due to rapidly rising\ndrug costs (Trish, Xu, and Joyce 2018). For enrollees whose 2022 prescrip-\ntion drug spending reached the catastrophic coverage phase (the highest\nspending phase in Part D) and who did not qualify for subsidized coverage,\naverage annual out-of-pocket spending was $3,093, more than 10 percent of\nthe typical income for an enrollee. Average out-of-pocket spending was far\nhigher for some serious health conditions (Sayed et al. 2024).\nExpanding and Strengthening U.S. Health Insurance Coverage | 165", "Expanding and Strengthening U.S. Health Insurance Coverage | 165\nIncreasing Financial Protection Against Prescription Drug Costs\nThe IRA, passed in August 2022, made several major changes to Medicare\nto reduce prescription drug expenses for beneficiaries and the Federal\nGovernment. First, the IRA limits out-of-pocket spending on insulin under\nMedicare Part B (effective July 2023) and Part D (effective January 2023)\nby removing any deductible for covered insulin products and capping co-\npayments at $35 per month per insulin prescription (Congress 2022a). In\n2019, prior to the changes made by the IRA, estimates indicate the average\nMedicare beneficiary paid $63 per insulin prescription fill, with nearly 40\npercent of beneficiaries paying more than $35 and roughly one quarter\npaying over $70 per fill (Sayed et al. 2023). Estimates suggest that the new\ninsulin cap could, on average, save affected Medicare beneficiaries about\n$500 per year.", "insulin cap could, on average, save affected Medicare beneficiaries about\n$500 per year.\nThe IRA also expanded eligibility for subsidized prescription drug cov-\nerage under Medicare Part D. Prior to 2024, the Low-Income Subsidy (LIS)\nprogram provided two tiers of prescription drug coverage to individuals and\nfamilies with little income and few assets. For individuals with incomes up\nto 135 percent FPL,10 the program provided a full subsidy, covering Part D\ndeductibles and premiums for certain plans and requiring minimal co-pays\nup to an out-of-pocket limit, followed by no cost sharing. For individuals\nwith incomes between 135 percent and 150 percent FPL,11 the LIS program\nprovided a partial subsidy with less financial assistance than the full subsidy\n(CRS 2023b). In 2024, the IRA expanded the LIS program\u2019s full subsidy\ncoverage of Medicare Part D prescription drugs to all individuals meeting\nthe eligibility criteria for the partial subsidy.", "the eligibility criteria for the partial subsidy.\nExpanding the LIS program is expected to benefit approximately\n460,000 people who now receive the full rather than partial subsidy, and\ncould encourage about 3 million more people who are eligible for Part D\nto enroll (Feyman et al. 2024). Of note, LIS enrollees are not charged the\ntypical Part D penalty for late program enrollment, a mechanism designed\nto limit adverse selection, removing any cost-related barriers to new Part D\nenrollment (CMS 2024l).\nThe LIS program expansion could help increase accessibility to drugs\nthat were previously unaffordable for some elderly Americans, as well as\nremove cost-related barriers to medication adherence. As seen in figure 4-6,\nelderly people with incomes qualifying for the LIS program have higher\nrates of skipping medication due to cost than elderly adults with incomes at\n200 percent FPL and greater.

In addition, certain\ngroups of Medicare beneficiaries automatically qualified for full LIS coverage.\n11 In 2023, the group included individuals with incomes between 135 percent and 150 percent FPL\nand fewer than $15,160 in assets; for married couples, the asset threshold was $30,240.\n166 | Chapter 4\nFigure 4-6.

Even\nafter reforms to close the coverage gap, the standard benefit design exposed\nbeneficiaries without LIS (approximately 72 percent of Medicare Part D\nbeneficiaries) to unlimited prescription drug expenses (Sayed et al. 2024).\nThe cost-sharing structure made beneficiaries responsible for 5 percent of\nall drug expenses surpassing a specified catastrophic coverage threshold\n(Cubanski and Neuman 2023). Nearly 1.5 million beneficiaries without LIS\nspent above the threshold in 2022 and paid an average of $3,093 in out-of-\npocket drug costs (Sayed et al. 2024). According to one analysis, Part D\nenrollees requiring the most expensive drugs faced annual out-of-pocket", "enrollees requiring the most expensive drugs faced annual out-of-pocket\nspending ranging from about $11,000 to nearly $15,000 per year (Cubanski\nand Neuman 2023).\nExpanding and Strengthening U.S. Health Insurance Coverage | 167\nUnder the IRA, the 5 percent coinsurance requirement for drug expen-\nditures greater than the catastrophic coverage limit was removed in 2024.\nStarting in 2025, Part D enrollees\u2019 out-of-pocket drug costs will be capped\nat $2,000, with the amount updated each year using the rate of growth in\nper-capita Part D drug costs (CMS 2024m; CMS 2024n). The IRA also\nshifts more of the expenses for prescription drugs from Medicare onto drug\nmanufacturers and Part D prescription drug plans. Finally, a premium stabi-\nlization mechanism in the IRA, which began in 2024 and continues through\n2029, limits average premium increases for individuals enrolled in Part D\n(CMS 2024o). The Department of Health and Human Services estimates", "(CMS 2024o). The Department of Health and Human Services estimates\nthat the 2025 change, along with the other changes discussed, will lead to\na roughly $7.4 billion reduction in annual out-of-pocket spending among\nenrollees with out-of-pocket savings, about 36 percent of Medicare Part D\nbeneficiaries, amounting to almost 19 million individuals. This translates\ninto an expected reduction in annual out-of-pocket spending of about $400\nfor these individuals (Sayed et al. 2024).\nNegotiating Drug Prices to Bring Down Costs\nThe IRA also allows the Medicare program to negotiate certain phar-\nmaceutical prices. Prior to the Act\u2019s passage, Medicare and the Federal\nGovernment were forbidden from negotiating directly with drug companies\nto lower costs (CRS 2022). The Federal Government was, therefore, unable\nto use its market power to buy and provide drugs at lower prices. According\nto CMS, Medicare is projected to account for an estimated 35 percent of all", "to CMS, Medicare is projected to account for an estimated 35 percent of all\nprescription drug expenditures in 2024, indicating the program represents a\nlarge share of the market (CMS 2024p).\nBeginning in 2024, the IRA requires the Department of Health and\nHuman Services to negotiate with drug companies for certain high-cost\ndrugs. Under the IRA, drugs with high Medicare spending shares that meet\ncertain criteria are eligible for price negotiation.12 Initially, 10 drugs from\nMedicare Part D were subject to negotiation, but the number will increase\neach year and begin to include drugs from Medicare Part B, with a total of\n60 drugs being price negotiable by 2029 (CBO 2023).\nIn August 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration announced the first\nset of prices, which will become effective in 2026, for all 10 drugs selected\nfor the first round of negotiation (CMS 2024q). CMS estimates that if the\nnegotiated prices had been in place in 2023, Medicare net prescription drug", "negotiated prices had been in place in 2023, Medicare net prescription drug\nspending on the products would have been lowered by 22 percent (CMS\n2024r). Moreover, the reduced prices are likely to help Medicare benefi-\nciaries who previously paid cost-sharing on the drugs\u2019 list prices; in 2022,\n12 For more information on the criteria for drugs to be eligible for price negotiation, see CMS\n(2024s).\n168 | Chapter 4\nnearly 15 percent of all Medicare Part D beneficiaries used at least one of the\ndrugs negotiated (ASPE 2023). In total, in 2026, CMS estimates beneficia-\nries will save $1.5 billion in reduced cost-sharing because of the negotiated\nprices (CMS 2024r).\nThe ability of the Federal Government to negotiate Medicare Part\nD drug prices is expected to improve the federal fiscal outlook. When the\nnegotiated prices go into effect in 2026, it is estimated to save Medicare Part\nD about $6 billion (CMS 2024r). Between 2022 and 2031, the Congressional", "D about $6 billion (CMS 2024r). Between 2022 and 2031, the Congressional\nBudget Office estimates that the negotiated drug price provisions of the\nIRA will reduce the federal deficit by about $95 billion. Combined with\na requirement that drug companies pay Medicare if the prices for certain\ndrugs rise faster than inflation, the Medicare-related provisions of the IRA\nare expected to reduce the deficit by about $160 billion between 2022 and\n2031 (CBO 2022).\nThe Next Steps in Strengthening Health\nInsurance and Lowering Costs\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has made major strides towards accom-\nplishing its goal of expanding access to affordable health insurance and\nhealthcare for all Americans.

Emissions of GHGs, including CO , are a classic negative external-\n2\nity. When a firm or individual emits CO into the atmosphere, the costs are\n2\nborne by everyone, leaving few economic incentives for abatement actions\nto reduce emissions.2\nA fundamental role of government is to address externalities through poli-\ncies that alter incentives, and current Biden-Harris Administration efforts are", "cies that alter incentives, and current Biden-Harris Administration efforts are\nhelping to fundamentally change the country\u2019s carbon emissions trajectory.\nThis chapter will highlight the progress already made and discuss how to\nbuild on it to push all the way to net zero.\n1 Due to space constraints, this chapter does not discuss GHGs other than CO. The economics of\n2\nreducing non-CO emissions can differ significantly from those reviewed here. The Long-Term\n2\nStrategy of the United States (White House 2021b) discusses paths to achieve net zero, including\nstrategies related to other GHGs.\n2 Activities that generate CO, such as the burning of fossil fuels, often result in additional negative\n2\nexternalities via the release of hazardous air pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and\nvolatile organic compounds that affect humans and natural ecosystems.\n171\nCost-effective policies incentivize the lowest-cost abatement actions, a", "171\nCost-effective policies incentivize the lowest-cost abatement actions, a\nconcept known in environmental economics as the equimarginal principle.3\nPolicies that prioritize the lowest-hanging fruit will lead to different levels\nof decarbonization in different economic sectors, because each sector faces\nunique decarbonization costs and challenges. In addition, the most cost-\neffective way to reduce CO emissions need not lead to zero CO emissions\n2 2\nfrom every sector, because it can be more cost effective to achieve net zero\nby allowing emissions from some sectors and engaging in separate activities\nthat remove CO from the atmosphere to offset those emissions.\n2\nThis chapter considers four distinct components of moving to net zero CO\n2\nemissions. It begins by discussing how to achieve zero CO emissions in\n2\nU.S. electricity production, broadly considered both technologically pos-\nsible and inexpensive relative to abatement options in other sectors (Davis", "sible and inexpensive relative to abatement options in other sectors (Davis\net al. 2023). The chapter then discusses the potential for reducing emissions\nby powering more economic activity with clean electricity instead of fossil\nfuels, a process known as electrification. Next, it discusses how to decar-\nbonize economic activities that may be harder to electrify, including using\ncleaner fuels and improving energy efficiency. The chapter concludes by\ndiscussing the use of negative emissions technologies (NETs) to capture and\nstore emitted carbon that would be comparatively more costly to eliminate.\nAchieving net zero will involve a collection of policies for two reasons.\nFirst, there are many ways to address the central negative externality from\nCO emissions. Economists most commonly advocate for economy-wide\n2\ncarbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, which are designed to address the\nnegative externality in all sectors simultaneously and incentivize each sector", "negative externality in all sectors simultaneously and incentivize each sector\nto respond in the lowest-cost way (EPA 2024b). An alternate approach is to\n3 Formally, the equimarginal principle says that, to achieve a given amount of abatement, the\nmarginal cost of abatement should be equal across all sectors and firms. Otherwise, it is more cost\neffective to reallocate effort toward abatement activities with lower costs. Properly measured, the\ncost of abatement should reflect all costs and benefits, even those unrelated to CO abatement, and\n2\ninclude both short- and long-term costs.\n172 | Chapter 5\naddress emissions with a series of sector-specific policies, as in the historic\nlegislation passed during the Biden-Harris Administration.\nSecond, the negative externality from emissions is not the only market\nfailure relevant to achieving net zero. Another critical market failure is that,\ndue to positive externalities from knowledge spillovers, firms do not have", "due to positive externalities from knowledge spillovers, firms do not have\nprivate incentives to conduct sufficient research and development (R&D)\ninto the new technologies needed to make progress in achieving carbon\npollution-free electricity, expanding electrification, decarbonizing unelectri-\nfied activities, and deploying NETs. These knowledge spillovers also occur\nwhen firms initiate and scale up production, implying the need for govern-\nment to support demonstration and deployment of new technologies. In\nother cases, such as developing a network of electric vehicle (EV) charging\nstations or building long-distance electricity transmission infrastructure, the\ngovernment can help solve coordination problems that prevent the private\nmarket from making sufficient investments in deploying new technologies.\nUnderstanding the Past, Looking to the Future\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has set targets of achieving a carbon", "The Biden-Harris Administration has set targets of achieving a carbon\npollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net zero GHG emissions economy\nby 2050 (White House 2023).

If renewables could be transmitted to locations with higher demand,\nthey could push out higher-cost fossil fuel production, leading to cheaper\nelectricity and fewer emissions in the receiving area. The financial benefits\nof transmission across interconnections have been estimated to be as high\nas almost three times greater than their cost on average (Bloom et al. 2020).\nPlanning for long-distance transmission is particularly difficult because\nthe lines must pass through many states, Tribal lands, and privately owned\nproperties. Moreover, the United States does not have a planning authority", "properties. Moreover, the United States does not have a planning authority\nto coordinate inter-grid transmission projects (Joskow 2021). This inability\nto coordinate stakeholders when a project\u2019s benefits are widely distributed\nis a classic market failure (Coase 1960). There is also considerable scope to\nupgrade transmission capacity without building new lines (O\u2019Boyle, Baker,\nand Solomon 2024), including reconductoring lines with high performance\nconductors and deploying grid-enhancing technologies. Such investments\nare not subject to the same coordination problems and can provide faster and\nmore cost-effective routes to upgrading the grid.\nIncreased transmission would cause wholesale prices to rise in some\nregions and fall in others (Davis, Hausman, and Rose 2023). Locations send-\ning electricity over long distances would tend to see prices increase, while\nreceiving locations would see prices decrease. Thus, some power producers", "receiving locations would see prices decrease. Thus, some power producers\nin receiving regions have incentives to block new transmission projects\n(Hausman 2024; Davis, Hausman, and Rose 2023).\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has taken steps to address the\ncosts and coordination challenges that impede new transmission projects.\nThe Administration funds large-scale interregional transmission projects\nthrough the $2.5 billion Transmission Facilitation Program and grid resil-\nience through the $10.5 billion Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships\nProgram (GRIP), both introduced under the BIL (DOE 2023e; DOE\n2024i; DOE n.d.b). The Administration has also created the Coordinated\nInteragency Transmission Authorizations and Permits Program, which aims\nto speed up the federal permitting process for transmission projects, and\nthe National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor Designation Process to\nexpedite key projects (DOE n.d.c; DOE 2023f). The Federal Government", "expedite key projects (DOE n.d.c; DOE 2023f). The Federal Government\nalso supports state-level actions through programs like the Federal-State Grid\nModernization Initiative, technical assistance from the National Labs, and\nlow-cost financing through the DOE Loan Programs Office (White House\n2024b; Lawrence Berkeley National Lab n.d.; DOE 2024j). Additionally,\nthe independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has intro-\nduced new rules to expedite regional transmission projects (FERC 2024a).\nPermitting for Energy Generation\nInfrastructure projects, including clean energy and transmission projects,\nmay be subject to a variety of state and local requirements, such as land\nAchieving a Net Zero Carbon Dioxide Emissions Economy in the United States | 191\nuse and zoning laws, as well as federal statutes including the National\nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires agencies to consider\nthe reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of major federal actions,", "the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of major federal actions,\nwhich can be done through an environmental impact statement (EIS),\nenvironmental assessment (EA), or categorical exclusion. NEPA reviews\noften serve as a vehicle for projects to address compliance with substantive\nfederal environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act, the\nNational Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act,\nand more (Luther 2011). EISs require the most thorough agency reviews and\nhave historically taken several years, on average, for agencies to complete,\nwhich can delay the buildout of clean energy infrastructure (Morales and\nRigby 2023).\nPermitting requirements change the economic incentives to undertake\nclean energy projects by creating deterrents to investment. The financial\nreturn on a project is determined by the present discounted value of future\nprofits, which depends on the size of future profits, how long firms must", "profits, which depends on the size of future profits, how long firms must\nwait to receive them, the interest rate, and the certainty with which profits\nwill be received. Permitting affects the present discounted value through two\nchannels. First, delays in permitting processes can delay projects and push\nprofits further into the future. Second, permitting can increase uncertainty\nabout whether projects will come to fruition. Both effects decrease the risk-\nadjusted return to financial capital tied up in a project, creating additional\nbarriers to new clean energy generation unrelated to the cost of generation.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has taken steps to improve the\nefficiency of the federal permitting process. First, the IRA allocated $1\nbillion to hire experts and invest in new technologies to expedite review\n(White House 2024c). Additionally, amendments made to NEPA in the\nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and implemented by the Council on", "Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and implemented by the Council on\nEnvironmental Quality\u2019s Bipartisan Permitting Reform Implementation\nRule now require that an EIS must not exceed 150 pages (or 300 pages for\na proposal of extraordinary complexity) and must be completed within two\nyears, while an EA must not exceed 75 pages and must be completed within\none year (White House 2024c; CEQ 2024). These reforms will further the\nprogress the Biden-Harris Administration has already made in cutting six\nmonths off the median time it takes for agencies to complete EISs, while\nprotecting the environment and communities (White House 2024d).\nInterconnection Queues\nBefore new energy generation projects can be connected to the grid, trans-\nmission operators must ensure that the grid can handle the increase in load.\nHistorically, projects have been evaluated in the order they are submitted.\nEach additional project in the queue then imposes a cost on future projects", "Each additional project in the queue then imposes a cost on future projects\nby increasing wait times, which can delay the return on investment and\n192 | Chapter 5\ndissuade investors from undertaking otherwise-profitable clean energy gen-\neration projects (Johnston, Liu, and Yang 2023). Because these costs do not\nenter into firms\u2019 decisions to join the queue, this creates a negative external-\nity that can lead to inefficient project selection, and government intervention\nto decrease wait times can increase completions. If the grid is at capacity,\nnew applicants must also pay to upgrade transmission infrastructure, provid-\ning positive spillovers to other projects that can free-ride on their investment\n(Johnston, Liu, and Yang 2023). Using BIL funds, the DOE has analyzed\nsolutions for reducing interconnection queues (DOE 2024k) and invested\nin interconnection infrastructure, including through the $10.5 billion GRIP\nand Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program (DOE 2024j). FERC Order", "and Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program (DOE 2024j). FERC Order\n2023 also aims to reduce interconnection queues by guiding transmission\nproviders to conduct batch studies of multiple projects at once, as well as\nincentivizing faster completion (FERC 2024b; DOE 2024j).\nDemand Response\nVariability in renewable energy availability can also be addressed by adjust-\ning demand, much like congestion pricing for traffic. Most retail consumers,\nincluding households and small businesses, do not pay retail rates that fully\nreflect changes in the cost of producing electricity (Borenstein, Bushnell,\nand Mansur 2023). This means that many customers have no incentive to\nadjust their consumption patterns to match the availability of cheap, renew-\nable energy. Allowing electricity prices to reflect fluctuations in demand\nor supply (e.g., after sudden increases in heat or drops in the availability of\nwind power) could help consumers time their electricity consumption for", "wind power) could help consumers time their electricity consumption for\nwhen renewables are available (Joskow and Wolfram 2012).\nNew technologies, such as digital meters and advanced sensors, make\nit easier for consumers to adjust electricity demand in response to changes in\nelectricity prices (DOE n.d.d). They can help consumers respond to changes\nin electricity prices without having to take additional action or even be\naware of the rate changes (Bollinger and Hartmann 2019). Recent evidence\nsuggests that time-varying prices with caps to limit consumer spending can\nimprove the timing of energy demand (Hinchberger et al. 2024). Demand\nresponse can also be used by environmentally conscious consumers to real-\nlocate demand in the absence of time-varying electricity prices. The Biden-\nHarris Administration has promoted demand response programs as part of a\nwider effort to promote the use of automation technologies to better balance\nelectricity supply and demand (DOE 2023g).", "electricity supply and demand (DOE 2023g).\nCarbon Capture and Storage\nMany efforts to decarbonize electricity focus on ensuring that new clean\ngeneration displaces fossil fuels. Another approach is to alter the process of\nfossil fuel combustion to reduce CO emissions. Carbon capture and storage,\n2\nAchieving a Net Zero Carbon Dioxide Emissions Economy in the United States | 193\nor CCS, is a term for a suite of technologies that aim to capture CO from\n2\nprocess exhaust and prevent it from reaching the atmosphere.14 The equimar-\nginal principle implies that CCS should be used at power plants to reduce\nemissions when it is less expensive than using a combination of renewables\nand storage, other generation technologies, or adjusting demand. As a result,\nCCS can be used to ensure that the economy achieves net zero CO emis-\n2\nsions as quickly as possible and can be phased out when zero-carbon energy\nsources become lower cost alternatives to supply all electricity. Knowledge", "sources become lower cost alternatives to supply all electricity. Knowledge\ngained from R&D and deployment of CCS in the power sector will spill over\nto other sectors that make use of CCS.\nThe EPA has found that CCS is a cost-effective way to reduce emis-\nsions, and its recent regulations adopted under section 111 of the Clean\nAir Act will require all long-term coal-fired plants and some new gas-fired\nplants to control 90 percent of their CO emissions (EPA 2024d). This regu-\n2\nlatory design requires firms to limit emissions without mandating use of a\nspecific technology, incentivizing them to do so in the least expensive way\npossible. CCS is a cost-effective way to comply in part due to tax credits\nthat were increased and extended by the IRA, highlighting the interaction of\nrecent legislation and regulatory efforts in propelling the economy toward\nnet zero.\nElectrification\nGiven the potential for rapidly decarbonizing the electricity sector, further", "Electrification\nGiven the potential for rapidly decarbonizing the electricity sector, further\nelectrification of the economy is crucial for reaching net zero. This section\ndiscusses the economics of electrification in each sector of the economy.\nThe Transportation Sector\nIn 2023, transportation contributed nearly 40 percent of energy-related CO\n2\nemissions (see figure 5-1). Electrification offers significant opportunities\nfor reducing emissions not only from fuel consumption, but also from fuel\nproduction, vehicle manufacturing and maintenance, and infrastructure.\nPersonal vehicles.

As of the second quarter\nof 2024, low-emissions vehicles made up 9 percent of new vehicle sales, up\nfrom less than 1 percent in 2014, and battery EVs alone made up 7 percent\n(EIA 2024f). As older ICE vehicles are retired, the share of EVs on the road\nwill increase.\nThere are two main challenges to increasing EV adoption, both of\nwhich the Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to address. First,\nEVs have historically been more expensive than ICE vehicles in the United\nStates, although the market prices are converging (see figure 5-14a) in part\nthanks to government support for R&D (White House 2024e) and critical\nmineral supply chains (White House 2022). In addition, the IRA funds EV\ntax credits that lower the price for many consumers below the trend shown\nin figure 5-14a, and EVs often have lower operating costs (Treasury 2024;\nOrvis 2022). Second, consumers have concerns about EVs\u2019 range and ease", "Orvis 2022). Second, consumers have concerns about EVs\u2019 range and ease\nof travel. ICE vehicles have historically been able to travel farther than EVs\nbefore refueling (although EV and ICE vehicle ranges are converging, as\nshown in figure 5-14b), charging typically takes longer than filling a gas\ntank, and charging stations are not as common as gas stations.\nTo make EVs better substitutes for ICE vehicles, complementary\ninvestments are needed to extend battery range and build charging stations\n(Rapson and Bushnell 2024). Without government intervention, investment\nin charging stations would be insufficient because of a coordination problem:\nInvestments in charging stations are not profitable unless many people drive\nEVs, and fewer consumers will buy an EV if charging stations are not avail-\nable along long-distance routes (Gillingham and Stock 2018). In response,\ninvestments from the BIL and IRA are working to reduce EV prices,", "investments from the BIL and IRA are working to reduce EV prices,\nincrease range, and expand charging networks, which have contributed to\nthe quadrupling of EV purchases and the doubling of the number of publicly\navailable chargers since the Biden-Harris Administration took office (White\nHouse 2024e; DOT 2024). More than $25 billion of investment in the U.S.\nEV charging network has been announced to date, including over $10 billion\nfrom the private sector (White House 2024e). The investments may need to\nbe adjusted over time to keep adoption on track. These investments will also\nencourage adoption of electric medium-duty vehicles such as delivery vans.\nShared transit.

A recent study finds that optimal fares for public transit can\nbe as low as $0.16 and optimal service is more frequent when emissions\nand congestion are taken into account (Almagro et al. 2023). The benefits\nof expanding the use of a fully electric, zero-emissions public transit fleet\nwould be greater.\nFederal, state, and local governments can act to make a rapid transition\nto an electrified public transit system. For example, the EPA\u2019s Clean School\nBus Program buys electric school buses with funding from the BIL (EPA\n2024f). Federal funding and incentives for the electrification of rail can help\nfund the replacement of older, high-emissions locomotives with new electric", "fund the replacement of older, high-emissions locomotives with new electric\nlocomotives (Federal Railroad Administration 2024).

Freight is transported by container ship, rail, air, and heavy-\nduty vehicles. While inexpensive batteries could enable the electrification of\nheavy-duty vehicles (Ledna et al. 2024) and shorter-distance, interregional\ncontainer shipping (Kersey, Popovich, and Phadke 2022), decarbonizing\nglobal shipping and aviation will likely make use of other technologies that\nwill be discussed later.\nThe Residential and Commercial Building Sectors\nDirect emissions from buildings comprise 12 percent of annual U.S. CO\n2\nemissions (EIA 2024a).

CCS is more likely\nto be both a short- and long-term solution in these sectors, unlike in the\npower sector where it is likely to be a short-term tool for speeding up the\ntransition (Browning et al. 2023).\nNegative Emissions Technologies\nReaching net zero will require offsetting emissions from sectors where cost-\neffective mitigation is not feasible (DOE 2022b). In other words, there is a\nneed for NETs, which can allow the economy to reach net zero even when\ncarbon emissions still occur in some sectors.", "carbon emissions still occur in some sectors.\nBiological NETs are any biological process pulling CO from the\n2\natmosphere, usually through plant growth, to maintain or enhance natural\ncarbon sinks. In particular, forest growth consumes significant CO , and\n2\nsome farming practices can increase the carbon uptake of soil.\nTechnological NETs are engineered systems that remove CO from\n2\nthe atmosphere. The simplest technological NET is direct air capture and\nstorage (DACS). DACS pulls CO from the atmosphere using chemical\n2\nreactions (IEA 2024a). DACS requires an external source of energy that may\nitself be produced with either fossil fuels or carbon-free energy sources. As\na result, the net cost of using DACS to remove emissions depends on both\nthe technology for capturing and storing emissions and the technology for\ngenerating the energy inputs.\nBioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a hybrid NET\nthat involves growing, harvesting, and converting plants into electricity or", "that involves growing, harvesting, and converting plants into electricity or\n204 | Chapter 5\nbiofuel (IEA 2024b).15 In the conversion process, CCS is applied to capture\nand store emissions. Unlike CCS used to decarbonize fossil fuel electric-\nity generation, BECCS can result in net negative emissions because plant\ngrowth pulls CO from the atmosphere.\n2\nThe ability of DACS and BECCS to yield net negative emissions,\nrather than simply preventing new emissions, makes them potentially\nimportant tools for meeting international targets to limit global temperature\nchange, like the 1.5\u20132 degrees Celsius goal in the Paris Agreement. While\nthe Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s targets are expressed in terms of flow\nemissions, long-run climate targets depend on the stock of carbon in the\natmosphere. As highlighted by the United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC), negative emissions can play an important role", "on Climate Change (IPCC), negative emissions can play an important role\nby offsetting positive emissions that occur during the transition to net zero\nand legacy emissions from before the transition in order to keep total warm-\ning from exceeding the target (IPCC 2018).\nRecent analyses show great potential for NETs to contribute signifi-\ncantly to achieving net zero by 2050 (Pett-Ridge et al. 2023; IPCC 2018).\nHowever, due in part to the early stage of development and significant\ntechnology uncertainties, a wide range of costs for technological NETs have\nbeen reported.16 DACS is currently considered too expensive to be widely\ndeployed. Producing electricity with BECCS is less expensive than using\nDACS, but still costs more than other abatement options. Certain biological\nNETs, such as afforestation/reforestation, are much less expensive but may\nbe less permanent, since, for example, the carbon stored in a forest would", "be less permanent, since, for example, the carbon stored in a forest would\nbe released if it were burned or cleared (NASEM 2019; Cook-Patton et al.\n2020; Fuss et al. 2018).\nThe equimarginal principle suggests there is no need to undertake\nan action that reduces emissions at a higher cost than it takes to remove a\nton of emissions through NETs. For this reason, technological NETs are\noften referred to as the \u201cbackstop technology\u201d (Heal 2009). As technology\nimproves and the price of this backstop technology comes down, the upper\nlimit of the cost of reaching net zero will also decrease.\nR&D is expected to reduce the costs of DACS and BECCS meaning-\nfully (DOE n.d.e). For example, a survey of technical experts found an\nexpected decrease from the 2020 cost of DACS of over 50 percent by 2050\n(Abegg et al. 2024).

These flows\ninclude investment in stocks and bonds known as portfolio investment, real\nassets such as factories and equipment known as foreign direct investment\n(FDI), and cross-border lending by global banks. Capital inflows thus\nprovide an important source of funds that finance investment in the United\nStates. Analogously, U.S. firms and investors provide significant amounts\nof capital to finance investments in stocks, bonds, and factories around the\nworld.\nThe strength and resilience of the U.S. post-pandemic recovery helped to\nmake the United States a magnet for foreign investment. Equally important,\nthe Biden-Harris investment agenda in infrastructure, clean energy, and", "the Biden-Harris investment agenda in infrastructure, clean energy, and\nsemiconductor technology has served as a productive target for inflows.2\n1 International capital flows provide the United States numerous benefits, including access to\nfinancing, increased capital allocation efficiency, and enhanced diversification and risk sharing\nacross borders. More broadly, global financial flows allow capital to be allocated to the most\nproductive global investment opportunities.\n2 A significant share of this new foreign direct investment into the United States originates from\ntrading partner countries, such as Canada, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom (CEA\n2023a).\n207\nThe United States has increased its dominance of global financial flows,\nreceiving the highest share of international capital flows in 2022-2023.\nApproximately 41 percent of global gross inflows were destined for the\nUnited States, almost doubling the country\u2019s pre-pandemic share of 23", "United States, almost doubling the country\u2019s pre-pandemic share of 23\npercent (Allen and Bems 2024). The United States\u2019 currency also plays a\nunique role on the international stage, functioning as a reserve currency,\ndenominating an outsized share of global trade, and denominating a large\nshare of cross-border financial transactions (Boz et al. 2020).\nA balance of pull and push factors helps determine the pattern of international\ncapital flows (Fratzscher 2012; Forbes and Warnock 2012; Obstfeld 2024).\nPull factors are domestic macroeconomic fundamentals, such as strong\neconomic growth relative to trading partners, that can draw in foreign capital\nflows, allowing countries to invest in amounts exceeding the domestic sav-\nings pool. The strength of property rights institutions, investor protections,\nand corporate governance standards can also serve as pull factors on foreign\ncapital (Chari 2020).

Emphasizing pull factors and demand-based explana-\ntions suggest that some countries invest more than they save domestically\ndue to expenditures at home financed by foreign capital inflows. Here,\ndomestic macroeconomic fundamentals and domestic absorption patterns\nin receiving countries are the underlying drivers of current account deficits.\nPush factors are common global factors that can move global savings\ntowards certain destinations. Events like flights to safety during times of\nheightened global economic uncertainty can push funds, as can precaution-\nary motives for channeling savings into reserve or safe haven currencies\n(Chari, Dilts Stedman, and Lundblad 2022; Goldberg and Krogstrup 2023).\nAnother push factor dynamic was described by former Federal Reserve\nchairman Ben Bernanke in 2005 in the context of the \u201cglobal savings glut,\u201d\nwhere excess savings in the rest of the world drove down global real interest", "where excess savings in the rest of the world drove down global real interest\nrates (Bernanke 2005).

After a brief discussion of the U.S. cur-\nrent account, this chapter explores the financial account of the United States\nby tracking its different types of claims and liabilities. Given that flows of\ninternational capital into and out of the United States are the counterparts\nto the international trade transactions of imports and exports, we begin by", "to the international trade transactions of imports and exports, we begin by\nproviding a broad overview of the U.S. current account.

Attention is also paid to the international\nrole of the dollar and the holdings of U.S. dollar reserves as safe assets by\nforeign investors.\nThe Current Account and Financial Account\nBalance of payments accounts divide international transactions into three\nbroad categories: the current account, the capital account, and the financial\naccount.

The\ncurrent account has averaged a deficit of $552 billion over the period, rep-\nresenting 3.3 percent of GDP. In 2023, the current account deficit was $905\nbillion, of which the balance on trade in goods and services was almost $785\nbillion. In 2023, income receipts were $1.57 trillion, and income payments\nwere $1.69 trillion (BEA 2024a). Canada, China, and Mexico were the top\nU.S. trade partners in 2023, accounting for more than 30 percent of the\ncountry\u2019s exports and imports.\nBreaking down the trade deficit into goods and services provides\nuseful insight. The U.S. goods deficit ($1.1 trillion in 2023) overshadows\nthe surplus in U.S. services trade ($278 billion in 2023), but notably the\nUnited States maintains a global comparative advantage in services exports.\n210 | Chapter 6", "United States maintains a global comparative advantage in services exports.\n210 | Chapter 6\nMost of the services surplus has been driven by digitally-enabled services,\nwhich include all activities performed with information and communication\ntechnologies. Digital services are the fastest-growing trade category as the\nUnited States moves toward an increasingly services-based and digitally-\nenabled economy (CEA 2024b).\nEconomists have alternative views about the fundamental causes of\nAmerica\u2019s persistently negative trade balance. Aligning with a focus on\nglobal push and pull factors, some economists note the role played by high\nsavings rates in other countries, which can contribute to large capital inflows\ninto the United States (Bernanke 2005; Pettis 2017). Such flows can boost\nproductive investment. They can also depress savings rates and raise aggre-\ngate demand if they lower interest rates or contribute to the formation of", "gate demand if they lower interest rates or contribute to the formation of\nbubbles.4 The latter dynamic can contribute to more debt-fueled consump-\ntion than is healthy (Obstfeld 2017). Additionally, such flows tend to appre-\nciate the country\u2019s exchange rate, and can contribute to an increase in the\ntrade deficit if a country\u2019s exports become more expensive and uncompeti-\ntive on world markets while imports become cheaper. Recent trends in the\nexchange rate show that the U.S. dollar (hereafter referred to as the dollar)\nhas risen by 7.4 percent in nominal terms relative to a representative basket\nof trading-partner currencies since 2020, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nBroad Dollar Monthly Index as of October 2024, and the real trade-weighted\nvalue of the dollar is 15 percent above its 20-year historical average.\nForeign countries can have high savings rates for various reasons,\nranging from demographic factors like an aging population to govern-", "ranging from demographic factors like an aging population to govern-\nment policies suppressing consumption and thereby encouraging savings.\nRelevant government policies include limited public retirement systems or\ninsufficient social safety nets leading households to save more than they\notherwise would for precautionary purposes (Zhang et al. 2018). The impli-\ncation of this dynamic is that trading-partner countries can play a role in\nshaping trade balances of other countries (Gourinchas et al. 2024).\nIt is important to recognize that a negative trade balance does not\nconstitute a negative \u201cscore\u201d for an economy. Indeed, the United States\u2019\npost-pandemic recovery has been uniquely characterized by high levels of\nbusiness investment, one third of which has gone toward factory construc-\ntion (Van Nostrand 2024a). As a result, much of America\u2019s investment\nappears to be going to productive ends. Productivity is rising, business", "appears to be going to productive ends. Productivity is rising, business\nformation is increasing, and it is likely that these potentially lasting and\ntransformative advances would not be possible without the supportive role\nplayed by international financing.\n4 A widely cited example of unproductive investment is the housing bubble of the early 2000s\naccompanied by a consumption boom that culminated in a global financial crisis with lasting\nnegative effects on the U.S. economy.\nAmerica's Role in International Capital Flows | 211\nMoreover, the global increase in international trade with U.S. trading\npartners has been essential in increasing the supply of goods, services, and\ncapital. It has given rise to many new domestic business opportunities and\njobs in export sectors. It has fostered competition and boosted productivity.\nThis latter dynamic has been an especially favorable development over the\npast few years, motivated in large part by legislation that is crowding in", "past few years, motivated in large part by legislation that is crowding in\nprivate capital from abroad into critical new sectors of U.S. domestic pro-\nduction (CEA 2023a; CEA 2024c).\nHowever, it is also important to recognize that certain aspects of trade\nflows can have downsides. Non-market practices and policies deviating\nfrom rules-based trading conventions have hurt communities over the past\nfew decades (USTR 2024). In this vein, the Administration has taken conse-\nquential actions to protect American workers, producers, and taxpayers from\nviolations of rules-based trade, particularly against China\u2019s long-applied\nstrategy of capturing global market share, gained via subsidies and non-\nmarket policies and practices.

Between 2000 and 2023, the financial\naccount balance averaged $530 billion.5 The composition of gross capital\ninflows into the United States has varied over time.

Thus, the United States is increasingly the world\u2019s\nbrokerage (Tabova and Warnock 2024).\nThe high and rising demand for taking part in the U.S. financial eco-\nsystem is reflected in the rapid rise in U.S. foreign liabilities (i.e., domestic\nfinancial assets owned by foreign investors).

The difference was historically due largely to\nhigher yields on foreign debt compared to U.S. debt (Curcuru, Dvorak, and\nWarnock 2008). The low yields on domestic debt can be attributed to con-\ntinued high demand for U.S. debt offerings, due to their safety and liquidity\nin the eyes of investors in the United States and around the world as well\n222 | Chapter 6\nas steady Federal Reserve policy (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen\n2012).12\nForeign Direct Investment\nIn addition to buying American stocks and bonds, foreign investors often\nacquire partial or full ownership in domestic companies.

FDI can occur through the following channels: multinational\nfirms launching subsidiaries (known as \u201cgreenfield operations\u201d) in foreign\ncountries, the expansion of existing foreign operations, the acquisition of\nnew foreign assets through mergers and acquisitions, or investments in joint\nventures (BEA 2024d).\nThe United States has historically been the largest recipient of FDI\ninflows (Commerce 2024a). The increase is consistent with both the strength\nof investment opportunities in the U.S. economic recovery and Biden-Harris\nAdministration policies effectively crowding in foreign investment (CEA\n2023a; Van Nostrand 2024b).

Internal rates of\nreturn (IRR) are defined as the interest rates required to set the net present value of an investment\nequal to zero. A high IRR indicates an elevated return, as the payoff from the investment must be\ndiscounted at a higher rate to reduce it to zero in net present value terms. Similar to the annual\nreturns above, from 2003 to 2022 foreign investors had an IRR on their investments in the United\nStates of 8.7 percent, slightly higher than the 7.9 percent that American investors had abroad\n(Tabova and Warnock 2024).\nAmerica's Role in International Capital Flows | 223\nFigure 6-10.

The evidence refutes arguments\nthat the dollar is losing its dominance in the international financial system", "that the dollar is losing its dominance in the international financial system\nor that U.S. Treasuries are no longer desirable as safe haven investments.\nThe rising worldwide demand for U.S. Treasuries plays a key role in\nreducing the cost of financing American debt (Weiss 2022).

Bond purchases by the Federal Reserve\nduring the period of quantitative and monetary policy easing also served to\nlower yields (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen 2011).

Federal laws also directly influence\nstate policy and school practices; for example, they have helped ensure the\nrights of students with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (IDEA) and elevate more holistic measures of school per-\nformance under the Every Student Succeeds Act. Finally, federal grants and\nreporting requirements promote evidence-based policies, support workforce\ndevelopment, incentivize innovation, fund research, and expand data collec-\ntion to enhance K-12 education.\nSignificant public investments in the K-12 school system allowed the United\nStates to be a world leader in academic outcomes (both basic literacy and", "States to be a world leader in academic outcomes (both basic literacy and\nhigh school graduation rates) through much of the 20th century (Goldin\n2006; Snyder 1993). However, school districts have faced growing chal-\nlenges in hiring and retaining qualified teachers as salaries in K-12 educa-\ntion have not kept pace with those in the broader market. Some measures\nsuggest that student achievement began to decline in the decade following\nthe Great Recession. Moreover, aggregate statistics mask substantial inequi-\nties in educational resources, opportunities, and outcomes across individual\ndistricts and by student race and socioeconomic status. The COVID-19\npandemic exacerbated these longstanding challenges, causing a sharp\ndecline in academic achievement across multiple measures (particularly for\nless-advantaged student populations), increasing rates of chronic absentee-\nism, and creating an even more pressing need to support students\u2019 basic", "ism, and creating an even more pressing need to support students\u2019 basic\nneeds as well as their social-emotional and mental wellbeing.

In the\ntextbook model of economic growth, overall economic output is produced\nusing the workers in the labor force, capital inputs (e.g., infrastructure and\nmaterials), and technology. In models of endogenous growth (e.g., Mankiw,\nRomer, and Weil 1992; Romer 1994), education affects output through two\ndistinct channels: (i) a human capital effect which makes workers more\nproductive, and (ii) an innovation effect which facilitates technological", "productive, and (ii) an innovation effect which facilitates technological\nadvancements that increase the productivity of workers and capital (Biasi,\nDeming, and Moser 2022).\nEvidence on the Human Capital Channel\nBuilding on the seminal work by Mincer (1958), microeconomic research\nusing natural experiments and studies of twin siblings from the same house-\nhold with different levels of education has documented that completing an\nadditional year of schooling (largely holding quality constant) increases\nan individual's yearly earnings by 6 percent to 15 percent (Gunderson and\nOreopolous 2020). Recently, consensus has emerged around the importance\nof school quality. Leveraging variation within states over time, Doty et al.\n(2022) find that a 1 standard deviation increase in average eighth grade math\nachievement (roughly a 37 percentile point increase) is associated with an\n8 percent increase in adult earnings. More direct measures of school quality", "8 percent increase in adult earnings. More direct measures of school quality\nbased on randomized admissions lotteries document large differences in\neffects on student academic and life outcomes across individual schools\n(Angrist, Hull, and Walters 2022). Similarly, value-added models document\nhow highly-effective teachers increase students\u2019 educational attainment and\nearnings (Chetty, Freidman, and Rockoff 2014). Importantly, policies to\nenhance school quality, such as those increasing resources, also grow adult\nearnings (Jackson, Johnson, and Persico 2016; Rothstein and Schanzenbach\n2022).\nEvidence on the Innovation Channel\nTheories of endogenous economic growth argue that increases in education\noutput also affect economic growth by enabling innovation, which can both\nprovide direct benefits to society as a whole and enhance the productivity\nof individuals. Much of the evidence on education\u2019s role in generating ideas", "of individuals. Much of the evidence on education\u2019s role in generating ideas\ncomes from research on higher education. Historically, studies link the\nestablishment of land grant colleges to increased innovation and elevated\nregional incomes (Andrews 2021; Maloney and Caicedo 2022). Modern\n244 | Chapter 7\nevidence shows that the number of patents per capita is positively associated\nwith federal and state investments in higher education (Aghion et al. 2009).\nStudies also document how the establishment of universities increases\nlocal innovation internationally (Valero and Van Reenen 2019) and that\nexpanding access to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)\npost-secondary programs can lead to increases in patenting (Bianchi and\nGiorcelli 2020; Toivanen and V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2016).\nK-12 education systems play a fundamental role in preparing students\nto pursue higher education and become the next generation of innova-\ntors (Biasi, Deming, and Moser 2022). Bell et al. (2019) demonstrate that", "tors (Biasi, Deming, and Moser 2022). Bell et al. (2019) demonstrate that\none\u2019s environment, which is impacted by school quality rather than ability,\nlargely dictates whether an individual will become an inventor. As a result,\ndisadvantaged youth who are more likely to attend under-resourced and low-\nperforming schools are underrepresented among inventors.\nIn this spirit, the Administration has committed to fighting systemic\nbarriers to educational opportunity in multiple ways, including new invest-\nments in STEM education for underrepresented K-12 and college students\nand by promoting a more inclusive STEM workforce (White House 2024a).\nIncreasing investment in higher education helps expand the knowledge\nfrontier, and increasing investment in foundational skills taught in elemen-\ntary and secondary schools helps ensure that future innovators can reach the\nfrontier and realize their full potential.\nEducational Attainment, Knowledge Capital, and GDP Growth", "Educational Attainment, Knowledge Capital, and GDP Growth\nIdentifying the causal effect of schooling levels on overall economic growth,\nas measured by GDP, is challenging. However, estimates across a variety\nof empirical approaches find that a one-year increase in average years of\neducation for the entire working-age population\u2014a change that can take\nseveral years to unfold\u2014is associated with gains in real GDP between 5\npercent and 12 percent (Barro and Lee 2013).\nStudies examining both quantity of schooling and knowledge capital\nsuggest that test scores may be a stronger predictor of economic growth than\nyears of education. Here, test scores serve as an imperfect proxy for school\nquality because scores reflect both the effects of formal schooling and\nimportant factors outside of school that affect student (Altonji and Mansfield\n2011). Aggregate measures are also shaped by the changing demography of\nstudents served by school systems over time. Hanushek and Woessmann", "students served by school systems over time.

The CEA estimates that mean real\nweekly wages paid to college-educated workers who were not K-12 teach-\ners rose by 15.4 percent between 2000 and 2023 as worker productivity", "ers rose by 15.4 percent between 2000 and 2023 as worker productivity\nalso rose, in part due to technological innovation in other sectors of the\neconomy (Pardue 2024). This large increase in average weekly earnings for\nother college-educated workers appears to be driven by rising wages in the\nupper part of the earnings distribution, as median weekly real wages rose\nonly 1.5 percent during this period. Wages for elementary and secondary\nschool teachers did not keep pace, with mean weekly real wages rising by\nonly 4.3 percent and median weekly real wages falling by 4.8 percent.7 An\nimplication of this dynamic is that to avoid teacher shortages, wages (and\ntherefore total education costs) must increase over time for reasons unrelated\nto productivity gains in the education sector (Baumol 1967).8\nThe CEA examines how teachers\u2019 relative wages have changed over\ntime compared to workers of similar ages and degrees by estimating Mincer", "time compared to workers of similar ages and degrees by estimating Mincer\nearnings models, which compare wages across occupations in each year\nbetween 2000 and 2023, after accounting for age and educational attain-\nment.

Pre-K and kindergarten teachers are excluded, but both private\nand public elementary and secondary teachers are included.\n2025 Economic Report of the President\nThese overall patterns illustrate the differential effects of the compressed\nwage ranges for teachers, which are worsened by the fact that wage growth\noutside of teaching has been concentrated at the upper end of the earnings\ndistribution during the last two decades (Gould and Kandra 2022). Although\nthe analyses here focus exclusively on wages, similar analyses find that", "the analyses here focus exclusively on wages, similar analyses find that\nincorporating benefits only partially offsets these wage penalties, with large\ngaps in total compensation remaining (Allegretto 2024).\nBoth overall teacher supply and the characteristics of who decides to\nenter and remain in the profession are shaped by the lower average wages\nand constrained earnings distribution for teachers (Hoxby and Leigh 2004;\nChingos and West 2012). Although some individuals forgo higher potential\nearnings to serve as teachers because they see it as a calling, relying on\naltruism and individual passion for pedagogy is an insufficient labor force\nstrategy. Research documents how the teaching profession becomes less\nattractive to potential entrants during periods of stronger economic growth\n266 | Chapter 7\nwhen there exist more outside options for higher paying jobs (Nagler,\nPiopiunik, and West 2020). For example, Brummet et al. (2024) find that", "Piopiunik, and West 2020). For example, Brummet et al.

Among CTE teachers, research\nshows that those with career experience in growth industries such as health\nservices, information technology, and STEM fields are more likely to exit\nthe profession and have higher average earnings outside of teaching (Kistler,\nDougherty, and Woods 2024).\nA second obstacle is the rising cost of undergraduate degrees relative\nto the stagnant real wages for K-12 teachers, which has dramatically lowered\nthe value proposition of paying for college to become a teacher (NCES\n2023). Currently, 36.6 percent of public school teachers have outstanding\nstudent loan debt (Learning Policy Institute 2024). The CEA finds that the\naverage cost of a four-year degree relative to average real weekly salaries", "average cost of a four-year degree relative to average real weekly salaries\nincreased by 35.5 percent for K-12 teachers between 2000 and 2023, while\nincreasing only 17.5 percent and 6.1 percent for college-educated workers\nin nursing and accounting.\nLarge-scale layoffs in the K-12 education sector during economic\ndownturns can have prolonged negative consequences on the teacher labor\nmarket. Given the large share of district budgets dedicated to salaries and\nbenefits and the sensitivity of state funding to fluctuations in income and\nsales tax revenue, districts have few options to reduce their budgets without\nconducting layoffs. The size of the K-12 education sector contracted by\nmore than 300,000 positions in the wake of the Great Recession, with an\nestimated 120,000 teachers losing their jobs (Evans, Schwab, and Wagner\n2019; Griffith 2020). These job losses are particularly harmful for recruit-\ning new entrants into the profession given that many districts conduct", "ing new entrants into the profession given that many districts conduct\nlayoffs based on inverse seniority, meaning the newest hires are first to lose\ntheir positions, regardless of performance (Kraft and Bleiberg 2022). The\nCOVID-19 recession caused large-scale layoffs among primarily school-\nbased operational staff who were not needed during the time period when\nschools transitioned to remote learning (Gould 2020).\nFinally, non-monetary benefits enjoyed by teachers, such as profes-\nsional autonomy, family-friendly work schedules, and job security, are not\nas compelling as they once were. Although teachers enjoy holiday vacations\nand summers off, they report working nine hours more per week on average\n(53 vs. 44) and are twice as likely to say they experience frequent job-related\nstress and burnout than other college-educated full-time workers (Doan,\nSteiner, and Pandey 2024).
