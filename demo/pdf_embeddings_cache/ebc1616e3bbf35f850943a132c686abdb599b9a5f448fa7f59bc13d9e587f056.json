The foundry model allows foundries and design companies to\nfocus separately on the advancement of their distinct specialties. Foundries focus on the development\nof complex manufacturing process technologies that make it possible to squeeze billions of transistors\ninto a finger-nail sized chip. Foundries also shoulder most of the capital investment risk to prepare\nsubstantial capacity that can be shared and leveraged by multiple design companies. Leading foundries\ntypically have capital expenditures equal to a high percentage (e.g. 30% or more in recent years) of\ntheir annual revenue. This division of labor directly enables the thriving fabless semiconductor design\nindustry. Design companies focus exclusively on creating new semiconductor designs, products and", "industry. Design companies focus exclusively on creating new semiconductor designs, products and\napplications such as 5G, artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d), and autonomous driving. Among the leading\nfoundries, TSMC distinguishes itself as a pure-play service provider. TSMC does not design and sell\nits own semiconductor products and does not compete with its design company customers. This enables\ndeep trust between TSMC and its customers and allows close collaboration to unleash innovation for\nthe global semiconductor industry.\nTSMC is a publicly traded company headquartered in Taiwan. TSMC first began to manufacture\nsemiconductors in the United States in 1998 through investing and establishing WaferTech LLC,\nsubsequently renamed TSMC Washington, LLC (\u201cTSMC Washington\u201d), in Camas, Washington.

TSMC Respectfully Requests the Administration to Take Actions in this Proceeding That Will\nAllow TSMC Arizona to Proceed Expeditiously to Realize Its Plans for an Advanced\nSemiconductor GIGAFAB\u00ae Cluster in Arizona\na. Any Measures the Administration Adopts Should \u201cDo No Harm\u201d to U.S. Government Security\nPolicy Goals, which Include TSMC Arizona\u2019s Advanced Semiconductor Production\ni. Any Import Measures Should Not Create Uncertainties for Existing Semiconductor\nInvestments\nOnshoring advanced semiconductor production is extremely complex and requires\nsignificant advance planning, including management of manifold inputs from numerous", "significant advance planning, including management of manifold inputs from numerous\nsupply chain companies around the world. TSMC Arizona, like other manufacturers in\nhighly complex industries, has carefully developed long-term investment strategies and\ncommitted to extensive construction projects based on existing policy frameworks. To\nallow investments such as TSMC Arizona to proceed expeditiously, the Administration\nshould exempt TSMC Arizona and other companies that have already committed to\n5\nsemiconductor manufacturing projects in the United States from tariffs or other import\nrestrictions.\nIn its invitation for comments, the Department asked about \u201cthe feasibility of increasing\ndomestic semiconductor capacity,\u201d and as detailed above, the answer for advanced\nsemiconductors is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d The Department also asked \u201cwhether \u2026 tariffs or\nquotas are necessary to protect national security,\u201d and the answer is that imports that are", "quotas are necessary to protect national security,\u201d and the answer is that imports that are\ncritical to the construction and operation of advanced manufacturing facilities should be\nviewed as enhancing, not threatening, U.S. security. Simply put, U.S. security interests are\nserved by measures that facilitate the speedy advancement of semiconductor\nmanufacturing projects already underway and are diminished by measures that delay,\nimpede, or impair such projects. For example, imposing tariffs on SME imports will result\nin higher project costs and could delay progress, or in some instances endanger the\ncommercial viability of many announced projects and those still under consideration.\nMany of the imported SME and semiconductor materials are not currently available in the\nUnited States, whether in terms of quality or quantity. Programs to help accelerate the\ndevelop of semiconductor manufacturing clusters in the United States, such as our Arizona", "develop of semiconductor manufacturing clusters in the United States, such as our Arizona\nproject, will be critical to creating the demand necessary to motivate further supply chain\ninvestments to produce such SME and semiconductor materials domestically.\nAt a minimum, any tariffs or other import restrictions should be imposed with realistic\nadjustment times for TSMC Arizona and other U.S. businesses and investors who have\nalready committed to substantial U.S. semiconductor production. This would include\nensuring continued tariff-free access to inputs where local sourcing is unavailable or\nunfeasible or will take time to onshore, particularly from longstanding suppliers within the\necosystem. To this end, we applaud the Administration\u2019s decision to exempt several\ncritically import SME inputs from the proposed reciprocal tariffs, and we believe\npreservation of this exemption is vital to the success and sustainability of efforts to reshore", "preservation of this exemption is vital to the success and sustainability of efforts to reshore\nadvanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States.\nii. TSMC\u2019s Global Manufacturing Network Supports U.S. Customers\u2019 Innovation, and\nAny Import Measures Should Not Impede This Access\nNew import restrictions could jeopardize current U.S. leadership in the competitive\ntechnology industry and create uncertainties for many committed semiconductor capital\nprojects in the U.S., including TSMC Arizona\u2019s significant investment plan in Phoenix. It\nis important to note that cutting-edge semiconductors, such as those produced at TSMC\nArizona, cannot function alone; they need to work in tandem with other semiconductor\ncomponents, including varied legacy chips, to unleash their full power and functionality.\nTSMC\u2019s global network of fabs ensures our leading U.S. customers\u2019 needs for both\nadvanced and mature-node semiconductors can be met seamlessly to maximize their", "advanced and mature-node semiconductors can be met seamlessly to maximize their\nmarket competitiveness. TSMC\u2019s global manufacturing footprint also provides essential\nredundancy and offers reliable alternatives to avoid supply chain disruption. Additional\ntariffs or other restrictive measures on semiconductors could reduce the profitability of\nleading U.S. companies by limiting sourcing options, driving up production costs, and\n6\nreducing product demand. This, in turn, would affect their ability to fund future R&D,\nwhich is essential for sustaining or advancing their market and technology leadership.\nLower market demand for our leading U.S. customers\u2019 products may consequently reduce\ndemand for TSMC\u2019s manufacturing capacity and service onshore. As referenced above,\nour expansion plans in Arizona are to support our U.S. customers\u2019 demand. Diminished\ndemand could create uncertainty around the timeline for the construction and operation of", "demand could create uncertainty around the timeline for the construction and operation of\nour Arizona fabs. It could also undermine TSMC\u2019s financial capacity to timely execute its\nambitious Arizona project. Therefore, we respectfully request that the Administration\navoids imposing tariffs or other restrictive measures on semiconductors made outside of\nthe United States.\niii. Tariffs on Imports of End Products and Semi-Finished Products Would Reduce\nDemand for Semiconductors\nAs outlined earlier, the successful and timely completion of the planned TSMC Arizona\nproject depends on our expectation of growing demand for TSMC\u2019s manufacturing\ncapacity and service from our leading U.S. customers. Tariffs that raise the cost of end-\nconsumer products will lower demand for such products and the semiconductor\ncomponents they contain. Therefore, TSMC respectfully requests that any remedial import\nmeasures imposed resulting from this investigation not extend to downstream end products", "measures imposed resulting from this investigation not extend to downstream end products\nand semi-finished products containing semiconductors.\nb. Any Measures the Administration Adopts Should Be Pro-Growth and Facilitate the Expedited\nAdvancement of TSMC Arizona\u2019s Planned Advanced Semiconductor Cluster\nUnder Section 232, the Department has broad remit to recommend import adjustments and non-\ntrade related actions to the President of the United States, including pro-growth measures that\nwould facilitate planned investments in advanced U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. If the\nAdministration decides it is necessary to implement further measures to encourage onshoring\ninitiatives in the interest of U.S. national security, TSMC encourages the Administration to adopt\npro-growth measures. Investment incentives and further reductions to regulatory impediments that\nfacilitate the speedy construction of new production facilities would be more constructive towards", "facilitate the speedy construction of new production facilities would be more constructive towards\nadvancing the Administration\u2019s national security objectives than import restrictions. This would\nbetter serve the U.S. security interests at issue in this investigation by allowing the investments to\ncontinue uninterrupted.\nSuch remedial recommendations could entail programs to incentivize domestic production and\nimprove U.S. business competitiveness, including:\ni. Leveraging the tax code to enhance the competitiveness of semiconductor manufacturing\nin the United States. The Administration should pursue extension of the advanced\nmanufacturing investment credit (IRC \u00a748D), which currently expires on December 31,\n2026. Extension of the credit will be a critical support for our ability to continue building\nout our GIGAFAB\u00ae cluster. TSMC supports legislation recently introduced by\nRepresentative Claudia Tenney (R-NY), the Building Advanced Semiconductors\n7", "Representative Claudia Tenney (R-NY), the Building Advanced Semiconductors\n7\nInvestment Credit (BASIC) Act, to seek this extension. The bill would increase the \u00a748D\ncredit from 25% to 35% and extend the duration through 2030.\nii. Expediting permitting for new facilities and supporting infrastructure, such as air\npermitting, water infrastructure, and energy transmission and generation infrastructure, that\nare needed for facility operations. U.S. customers and government officials have\nencouraged TSMC Arizona to expedite its planned roll out and ramp up of its project, and\nTSMC is making significant progress towards achieving that aim. Pro-growth measures,\nlike expediting federal and state permitting and providing assistance to navigate regulatory\nrequirements that would otherwise delay expeditious planning, start-up, construction and\nmanufacturing activities, would help achieve this aim. President Trump\u2019s March 31", "manufacturing activities, would help achieve this aim. President Trump\u2019s March 31\nexecutive order to establish a U.S. investment accelerator indicates how the Administration\ncan use its resources to help companies navigate regulatory processes efficiently and\nreduce burdens.2\niii. Enhancing partnerships with the semiconductor industry and educational institutions to\nbuild the technology workforce of the future. With the rapid expansion of U.S.\nsemiconductor manufacturing underway, the Semiconductor Industry Association\nestimates that 58% of new jobs in the industry risk going unfilled at current degree\ncompletion rates.3 Increasing support for R&D programs to build a pipeline of scientists\nand engineers, along with expanding support for apprenticeships and university training\nprograms, can contribute significantly to addressing the emerging skills gap.\n* * *\nTSMC Arizona appreciates the opportunity to provide its perspective on the Administration\u2019s efforts to", "promote the U.S. semiconductor industry.
