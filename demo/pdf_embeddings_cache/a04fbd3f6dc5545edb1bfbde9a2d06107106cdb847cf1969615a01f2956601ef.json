Yet\nnearly a decade after their adoption, the gap between ambition and action has become\nstarkly evident. This report presents a roadmap built on actionable insights and\ntransformative ideas to bridge that gap, offering a vision for how some of the key\nstakeholders on our collective future can collaborate to deliver on these goals.\nCentral to this vision are a set of nine \"Big Ideas\u201d, innovative yet practical approaches to\naddressing the world\u2019s most pressing challenges, underpinned by the need to secure\npeace and dignity for all.

However, the scale of investment\nvi\nTechnology as a Force for Good, 2025 Report\nrequired to achieve the SDGs, estimated at $14-17 trillion annually, far exceeds what will\nbe released from current global financial flows.\nThis report describes how development needs can be turned into opportunities\nattracting capital and solutions in the places where they are most needed.

Technology Critical for Execution\nTechnology\u2019s Multidimensional Impact\nTechnology has a critical role to play in meeting the SDGs in general, and specifically in the\ninitiatives that underly the Big Ideas outlined above. Technology\u2019s impact on the goals is across\nmany levels. Some of the goals\u2019 underlying targets are specifically technology related, such as\nTarget 5.b (Enhancing the use of enabling technology, in particular information and", "Target 5.b (Enhancing the use of enabling technology, in particular information and\ncommunications technology (ICT), to promote the empowerment of women). or Target 17.7\n(Promoting the development, transfer, dissemination, and diffusion of environmentally sound\ntechnologies to developing countries), which are largely focused on the deployment, accessibility\nand use of digital technologies for a wide range of essential purposes.\n43\nTechnology as a Force for Good, 2025 Report\nMore generally however digital technology has a critical enabling role to play across most of the\ngoals. Research by the ITU and UNDP indicate that the use of digital technology can impact nearly\n70% of the 169 SDG targets.39\nTechnology\u2019s role in the solutions that implement the Big Ideas is similarly fundamental.

Adding up all the country level net benefits provides a picture of the global net\nimpact potential each solution can have.\nThe SDG impact of deploying initiatives on a country-by-country basis is assessed using data from\nthe 2024 Sustainable Development Report,42 which evaluates each country's performance against\nthe underlying indicators of the SDGs to measure overall progress. Countries are scored on a\nscale of 1-100, approximately reflecting their percentage completion of the SDGs. To estimate the\npotential impact of an initiative on a country's SDG score, the analysis applies the percentage\nuplift that the initiative is expected to contribute to specific SDG targets to the corresponding\nnational performance indicators. The resulting increase is then calculated to determine the\noverall improvement in the country\u2019s SDG score.\n59", "overall improvement in the country\u2019s SDG score.\n59\nTechnology as a Force for Good, 2025 Report\nAlthough the Sustainable Development Report does not provide an aggregated global SDG score,\nit covers countries representing 99.6% of the global population.

Overcoming these barriers to implementation will be critical for the world\nto meet the goals.\n5. Creating New Markets to Attract Solutions\nOne of the defining features of the Big Ideas is that they are not necessarily new, nor do they\ndemand groundbreaking innovation. For example, the water and filtration technologies essential\nto Deliver Human Essentials have been around for over a century, with recent advancements\nprimarily aimed at making them more affordable, efficient, and accessible. However, the long\n61\nTechnology as a Force for Good, 2025 Report\nexistence of some of these ideas have not necessarily made them any easier to execute. Indeed,\nthe internet has been around for 30 years but nearly 2.7 billion people - almost one third of the\nglobal population - still lack internet access,45 and 4.2 billion people live without safely managed", "sanitation services.46 This starkly illustrates the gap between the availability of simple solutions and\ntheir effective implementation.\nThe reason for this gap lies in the significant implementation challenges that these solutions face\naround the world. At the core of this gap is the disconnect between development needs and the\nopportunities that can address them. Development circles often confuse \u201cneed\u201d with \u201copportunity\u201d.47\nThe existence of need on its own does not create viable opportunities to satisfy that need in the\nabsence of critical catalysts. Policy and implementation are needed to create markets backed by a\nsystem of enterprise. In the absence of vibrant local markets, the necessary opportunities cannot\nmaterialize, and the SDGs will not be met, the many reasons for this include:\n1.) The SDGs Are Increasingly Unaffordable \u2026 Despite Record Global Wealth. The US$14-17 trillion of\nannual spending across healthcare, education, infrastructure, conservation, and economic", "annual spending across healthcare, education, infrastructure, conservation, and economic\ndevelopment required to meet (and maintain) the SDGs globally represents 13-15% of the world\u2019s\ncurrent GDP, (or c.10-12% of estimated GDP in 2030)48. While the world in theory has sufficient\ncapital to fund this amount today, with the annual requirement representing only 3-4% of the\ntotal global stock of US$433 trillion of liquid wealth, in practice sustainably funding the SDGs will\nrequire growing local economies to provide domestic capital for the goals.\nThe world\u2019s liquid wealth is overwhelmingly held in advanced industrialized economies and\nmanaged by the finance industry based on a\nDevelopment circles often confuse \u201cneed\u201d\nmandate to generate an appropriate risk-\nwith \u201copportunity\u201d.

Policy and U$$1.3 trillion of annual foreign direct\nimplementation need to create a market investment, less than 10% of the total funding\nbacked by a system of enterprise required to meet the SDGs,49 and less than 1%\nof global GDP. Growing global foreign direct\ninvestment ten-fold to fully fund the SDGs is a\nhighly unlikely prospect, no matter how attractive developing countries may make themselves to\ninternational investors.\n2.) The Imperative of Domestic Capital Formation to Fund the Goals. The limitations on deploying the\nworld\u2019s current stock of wealth implies that much of the funding for the SDGs will need to come\nfrom local (and regional) sources, which in turns requires significant economic expansion and\ncapital formation in developing countries. An average growth rate of 4.0% across the world\u2019s", "capital formation in developing countries. An average growth rate of 4.0% across the world\u2019s\ndeveloping countries would imply that an incremental US$15 trillion of GDP annually could be\ngenerated as early as 2032,50 (recognizing that some countries will by then be generating more\noutput than is needed for the SDGs and others less, and that only a portion of any incremental\neconomic activity generated can be applied to meet the goals.)\n62\nTechnology as a Force for Good, 2025 Report\nNevertheless, for a significant number of developed countries, the prospect of sustained economic\ngrowth places the SDGs within reasonable reach. This sustained economic growth however\npresupposes the creation of an attractive domestic market within a broader system of enterprise.\n3. Big Ideas Can Address SDG Progress \u2026 But Require International Engagement to Deploy. Scaled solutions\nlike the ones arising from the nine Big Ideas are potential flywheels not just for the achievement of", "specific SDGs and targets but more generally for the economic activity and growth need to meet the\ngoals. However as stated above, most countries around the world lack the technology, the capital and\nthe capacity to implement these solutions on their own. This makes successfully engaging solution\nowners, technology providers and sources of foreign capital a critical precondition to starting the\nvirtuous cycle of growth required to meet the SDGs.\n4. Solution Owners and Capital Address Opportunities Based on Risk Adjusted Returns. With many of\nrequired solutions in the hand of private sector corporations, countries will need to offer commercially\nviable opportunities for these corporations to engage with, offering both the outlook of sufficiently\nattractive returns and the adequate transparency and\nAn average growth rate of 4.0%\nmanagement of risks, be they political, economic, physical or\nacross the world\u2019s developing\notherwise.\ncountries would imply that an", "across the world\u2019s developing\notherwise.\ncountries would imply that an\n5.

Removing barriers to investment and\nearly as 2032\nmarket entry create the opportunity required for solutions\nowners and their providers of capital to meet a country\u2019s existing needs.

A\nglance at three the top five largest potential markets illustrates some of the systemic (and\n69\nTechnology as a Force for Good, 2025 Report\nidiosyncratic) challenges that states will face to unlocking this value.

If countries can\novercome these barriers the opportunities awaiting them are significant. The market opportunity\nsets associated with the SDGs are of course multi-dimensional given the breadth of the goals\nthemselves and therefore span many industry sectors. These opportunity sets can be broken\ndown into seven categories that collectively substantially cover the entire market value associated\nwith meeting the SDGs within a given country, each which represents a trillion dollar or greater\nmarket opportunity.

Six key considerations stand out in this regard:\n1. Owning Attractive Markets. The military-technology machine, the equivalent of the military-\nindustrial complex for tech, would involve governments and their trade negotiators,", "industrial complex for tech, would involve governments and their trade negotiators,\nintelligence agencies, and other arms of government having the job of securing advantage\nfor their largest technology companies.\n2. Escalating Technology Arms Races.

Focus on Strategic Technologies, Not Solving Global Problems. Countries would continue\nto focus on the disruptive and exponential technologies such as AI, fusion, and quantum\ntechnologies, given the disproportionate impact that these technologies can have on the\nfuture, and the power they provide to those that that control them.

Rising Rivalries Slow Progress on Key Breakthroughs. While competition between states\nhas been a key driver of technological progress in history,84 much of this progress has\nbeen on applied technologies, rather than on fundamental research, which relies of open\nknowledge sharing.

Access to Technologies Remains Highly Uneven. With escalating costs of R&D and many\ncountries unwilling to share technologies that they consider strategic, poorer nations\nstruggle to access critical resources and technologies, further exacerbating inequality\nbetween nations.

And in the absence of large\nmultilateral programs to solve global challenges like ocean acidification, or carbon emissions, tech\ncompanies will lack the funding to develop solutions for these areas (and lack the customers to\nbuy them too). In such a world, technology\u2019s role as a force for good will be greatly diminished and\nits potential to underpin human security for all will remain unfulfilled.\nThe world that this dynamic creates risks being less safe, less prosperous and less sustainable\nthan the world we live in today, with significant degradation of ecosystems, pollution, and", "than the world we live in today, with significant degradation of ecosystems, pollution, and\nresource depletion.

However, it may be a world that suits certain countries as a path to realizing their\ngeopolitical power ambitions, and so cannot be written off as irrational.\n4. Conclusion: The Rewards of the Future\nThe prospects of a world that underwrites secure, sustainable development to manage the\npresent while continuing to invest in the future is an optimistic one. This approach not only\nminimizes the risks and but also shortens the transition period to the future. The transition", "minimizes the risks and but also shortens the transition period to the future.

SDG Market Sizing\nThis report seeks to determine the total incremental market opportunity (across trade,\nconsumption, and investment) that meeting the SDGs creates on a country-by-country basis. To\nestimate the total market opportunity, Force for Good has drawn on data from an SDG costing\nproject conducted from UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and on SDG performance data\ndrawn from Sustainable Development Report 2024.85\nThe methodology for calculating the incremental market opportunity across the countries are as\nfollows:\n1. Estimation of the Initial Market Opportunity Arising from Meeting the SDGs Through the\nUNCTAD Project.\na. Description. The report has used the underlying data from the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) costing project by the United Nations Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) that estimate the spending needed to speed up", "Development (UNCTAD) that estimate the spending needed to speed up\nsustainable development worldwide and achieve the SDGs by 2030. The study\nfocuses on estimating the costs to achieve each of seven transformative\ncategories:\n1. Social protection and decent jobs\n2. Education transformation\n3. Food systems\n4. Climate change\n5. Biodiversity loss and pollution\n6. Energy transition and inclusive digitalization\n7. Gender equality\nThe study links these areas to 13 of the 17 SDGs: SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13,\n14, and 15.\nb. Assumptions. The UNCTAD project\u2019s seven categories focus on 13 out of the 17\nSDGs, but assumes that fully funding these seven will allow for the achievement of\nall the goals with no additional spending required. Further, while the project is\nfocused on estimating the cost of accelerating access towards the goals of the\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and has estimates for 90 economies", "2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and has estimates for 90 economies\ncomprising of 72% of the population, it also states these countries will represent\nthe substantial majority of the spend required to fulfill the seven categories, given\ntheir size and development needs. This report has taken a conservative\nassumption that the funding requirement estimated by the UNCTAD project for\neach category is the total amount of capital required to achieve such category\nglobally. Any additional spend required would represent either additional\nconsumption or investment capital, which would increase the total market\nopportunity of the goals.\n121\nTechnology as a Force for Good, 2025 Report\nc. Calculations. The report has taken the total estimated cost for each of the seven\ncategories and divided it by the global population. This gives an \u2018average cost per\nperson\u2019 needed to achieve each of seven transformative categories.", "person\u2019 needed to achieve each of seven transformative categories.\nAverage Cost per Person for Category = (UNCTAD estimated amount to fulfill\ncategory) / (Total global population)\n2. Calculation of the Gap Towards Achievement of Each SDG for All Countries.\na. Description. The Sustainable Development Report 2024 measures SDG\nachievement by country, scoring how close countries are to achieving the goals\nbased on their progress against the goals\u2019 underlying targets. Each country is\nassigned a score between 0 and 100, where 100 means the country has fully\nachieved the goals, and 0 means no progress. This country SDG score has been\nused to estimate the \u2018percentage gap\u2019, which provides an estimate of how far the\ncountry is from fulfilling each SDG goal.\nb. Assumptions. No additional assumptions used for calculating the percentage gap\nc. Calculation. The following calculations have been conducted:\ni. Find the maximum score achieved by any country and the minimum score", "i. Find the maximum score achieved by any country and the minimum score\nachieved by any country for each SDG.\nii. Subtract a country's SDG score from the maximum score achieved for the\nSDG to see how much more progress is needed.\niii. Use this difference to figure out the \u2018percentage gap\u2019 each country needs to\nclose to fully achieve each SDG. For example, the difference between the\nmaximum score and minimum SDG score, the \u2018percentage gap\u2019 will be 100\npercentage points and the lower the country\u2019s SDG score compared to the\nmaximum score, the higher the \u2018percentage gap\u2019 will be and the further the\ncountry is from fulfilling the SDG goal.\nPercentage Gap = (Maximum score achieved by a country in that SDG \u2013\nCountry\u2019s SDG score) / (Maximum score achieved by a country in that SDG)\n3. Estimation of the Total Gap in the Related SDGs for a Category of the UNCTAD Project.\na. Description. The UNCTAD project clearly maps the various SDGs that will be", "a. Description. The UNCTAD project clearly maps the various SDGs that will be\nimpacted by the seven categories. This \u2018percentage gap\u2019 is calculated for every\ncountry across each related SDGs for the different categories. An average of the\n\u2018percentage gap\u2019 across the related SDGs has been used to estimate the gap in\namount required per person for each country to fulfill that particular category.\n.\nb. Assumptions. A simple average for the different \u2018percentage gaps\u2019 across the\nvarious SDGs is a suitable method to estimate the total gap across the related\nSDGs for any category.\nc. Calculation.\ni. Percentage Gaps for Each SDGs with a Category. For each country, the\npercentage gap is calculated for all related SDGs within a category. For\n122\nTechnology as a Force for Good, 2025 Report\nexample, the category \u2018Social protection and decent jobs\u2019 impacts SDGs 1, 3,\n4, 5, 8 and 10. The percentage gap is calculated for every country across\neach of these 6 SDGs.", "4, 5, 8 and 10. The percentage gap is calculated for every country across\neach of these 6 SDGs.\nii. Average Percentage Gap for a Category. Once the percentage gap calculated\nfor each SDG goal within the related SDGs for a category, a simple average\nof the different percentage gaps is taken to calculate the total percentage\ngap to achieve all the related SDGs in a category for a particular country.\n4. Quantify Impact of Opportunity for Each Category Across Every Country.\na. Description. To understand the funding required for each category in every\ncountry, the \u2018average percentage gap\u2019 for a category is used to calculate the \u2018gap\namount per person\u2019, which is the additional amount that is required per person to\nfulfil the category in each country. This helps estimate how much more funding is\nneeded for each country to meet the SDG goals under that category.\nb. Assumption. The calculation assumes that:\nGap Amount Per Person = (Average Percentage Gap for Category) \u00d7 (Average Cost", "Gap Amount Per Person = (Average Percentage Gap for Category) \u00d7 (Average Cost\nPer Person for Category)\nc. Calculation.\ni. Gap Amount Per Person: Multiply the \u2018Average Percentage Gap\u2019 for a category\nby the \u2018Average Cost per Person\u2019 for that category.\nii. Estimate Total Funding Gap for Category: Multiply the \u2018gap amount required\nper person\u2019 by the total population of the country to estimate the total\nfunding gap needed to achieve the SDGs under the category. The funding\ngap for each of the countries is added to calculate the total funding gap for\nthe category.\nThis process is repeated for each category to calculate the total funding required for all\nseven categories across every country.\n123\nTechnology as a Force for Good, 2025 Report\nVII.
