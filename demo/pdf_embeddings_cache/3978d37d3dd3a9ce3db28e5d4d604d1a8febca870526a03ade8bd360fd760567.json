The CPUs and other semiconductor solutions that we design, manufacture, market, and sell are\nincorporated in computing and related end products and services, and utilized globally by consumers, enterprises, governments, and educational organizations. Customers of\nour semiconductor products primarily include OEMs, ODMs, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication\nequipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. We market and\nsell our semiconductor products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We also develop semiconductor", "fabrication process and packaging technologies and manufacture many of our semiconductor product offerings at our geographically diverse network of fabrication and assembly\nand test facilities. We are also seeking to expand as a third-party foundry for external customers.\nOur Strategy\nTechnology permeates every aspect of our lives and is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. As we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see\ncontinued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this digital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create\na resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers:\nubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together, these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each other, and", "increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We harness these superpowers for our customers' growth and\nour own.\nWe are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon, platforms, software, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these\nstrengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused on four key themes: product competitiveness, open platforms,\nmanufacturing at scale, and our people.\nOur Priorities\nProduct Competitiveness\nLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from data center to network, PCs, edge computing, and the\nemerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.", "emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.\nAt our core is the x86 ecosystem, which has served as a foundation of modern computing for over four decades. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86\nmicroarchitectures focused on performance and efficiency. In 2024, we announced the creation of an advisory group to expand the x86 ecosystem by enabling compatibility\nacross platforms, simplifying software development, and providing developers with a platform to identify architectural needs and features to create innovative and scalable\nsolutions for the future.\nBeyond the CPU, we deliver a family of xPU products encompassing client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that\ndifferent workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our", "strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories.\nWe also seek to address every phase of the AI continuum, from the largest, most challenging GenAI and large language models to emerging usages like AI PCs and AI at the\nedge. We believe AI represents a generational shift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems. We are in the early stages of realizing\nAI's full potential. Our strategy is to bring AI to where the data is being generated and used. We believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms that offer the\nopen and modular solutions for competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and AI everywhere. We are\ninfusing AI into Intel technologies, supporting today's GenAI workloads, fueling emerging usages like AI PC and AI at the edge, and pioneering innovations that we believe will", "help advance the future of AI in the next decade.\nOur product offerings are predominantly manufactured in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. In recent years, however, we have\nstrategically utilized third-party foundry manufacturing capacity where advantageous for cost, performance, schedule, or other reasons. This provides increased flexibility and\nscale, including in recent years the ability to continue to offer various products at the most performant end of the product spectrum where we did not yet have comparable\nprocess technologies in-house.\nOpen Platforms\nWe aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on\nopen standards-based platforms. We have helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt\u2122, and PCI", "Express. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux, Android, and others.\nOur Strategy 3\nWe deliver open-source code and optimizations that are designed for projects across numerous platforms and usage models. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly\ndesigning, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help software and hardware work better\ntogether.\nManufacturing at Scale\nWe manufacture a majority of our products in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. This enables us to optimize performance, shorten time-\nto-market for new product introductions, and more quickly scale products in high volume.\nProcess technology. We continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology as we seek to realize the benefits from Moore\u2019s Law, a law of economics", "predicted by Intel\u2019s cofounder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago. Realizing Moore\u2019s Law results in economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we\nshrink its size or increase functionality and performance of a chip while maintaining the same cost with higher density. This makes possible the innovation of new products with\nhigher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size to meet customers' needs. As of the end of 2024, our core products were manufactured on 300mm wafers,\nwith a significant majority manufactured using our Intel 7 process node while we ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes into high volume.\nFactory network. Our global factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience. We operate wafer", "manufacturing facilities in the United States (Oregon and Arizona), Ireland, and Israel, assembly and testing facilities in Costa Rica, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and\npackaging facilities in the United States (New Mexico), Costa Rica, Vietnam, and Malaysia. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major\nmanufacturer of semiconductors and we plan to continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.\nFoundry services. The very high capital requirements of modern leading-edge semiconductor process technology development and manufacturing, especially those nodes\nrequiring EUV lithography such as Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 18A and future nodes, require us to expand the use of our process technologies as they mature and grow the number of\nwafers produced beyond the expected growth for our own products. To this end, we are seeking to build a world-class foundry business also serving external customers and", "have made significant investments in ecosystem support to enable the usage of our manufacturing network by external customers. Our foundry offerings include four\ncomponents: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplets, and software and services. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable\nproducts built with our advanced packaging technology. We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and\nprocess technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other\necosystem IP.\nOur People\nOur world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do.

Our IP portfolio includes\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other\nassets.\nWe have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents\nrelated to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. As we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry", "business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third\nparties.\nThe software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors'\nproducts, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to\nidentify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the\ninformation that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.\nEfforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. Competitors", "and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to\nobtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While\nour IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.\nManufacturing Capital\nWe are one of only a few companies in the world with the process technology and manufacturing facilities to produce leading-edge semiconductor logic chips.\nProcess Technology\nOur technology development group, with its R&D and semiconductor fabrication facilities in Oregon, designs and develops each new process technology node before high-", "volume production is shifted to one of our high-volume manufacturing sites. With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and size to meet\nthe needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries\nrequires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing\ntechnologies, such as EUV lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A process\nnode, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node.\nAs of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in Arizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel", "3 process nodes as our first EUV lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A process\nnode to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A, that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named\nPanther Lake.\nOur Capital 8\nManufacturing Facilities\nOur geographically distributed network of semiconductor manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities allows us to produce advanced semiconductor logic chips in\nhigh volume. After a process technology node is developed by our technology development group, we seek to shift production to one or more high-volume manufacturing\nfacilities. Maintaining reliable production capacity is of critical importance. Wafer and packaging manufacturing facilities take a number of years to build, making it prudent to build", "space ahead of demand. We refer to this strategy as \"shell ahead.\u201d As a result of the supply shocks driven by the Covid-19 pandemic and the projected growth of our products\nbusinesses, we set out to expand our capacity network beyond our existing wafer production facilities in Oregon (mostly utilized for technology development and early production\non new nodes), Arizona, Ireland, and Israel to meet this demand and get to \u201cshell ahead\u201d status. We are in the later stages of an expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in\nIreland for our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes and undertaking a significant expansion of our Arizona facility for our upcoming Intel 18A process node. We are building a new\nwafer production facility in Ohio and have plans for an additional new wafer production facility in Germany, but have slowed the completion of the Ohio facility and put the plans", "for the facility in Germany on hold as we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and sought to limit our capital expenditures given recent financial results. We\nhave assembly and test facilities in Costa Rica, China, Malaysia, New Mexico, and Vietnam. We are expanding our facilities in New Mexico and Malaysia, though we recently\nreduced the extent of the expansion plans for Malaysia. We have plans for an additional assembly and test facility in Poland, but have put those plans on hold in conjunction with\nthe delay of the facility in Germany.\nSemiconductor manufacturing requires extremely sophisticated equipment, and we work closely with the tool vendors to align their roadmaps to our needs. In 2024, we made the\ntransition from non-EUV lithography to EUV lithography with the Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes. EUV lithography equipment drives a higher capital investment than the\npreceding lithography technology.", "preceding lithography technology.\nSemiconductor manufacturing is a capital-intensive industry. Over the past four years, we have made outsized investments across three categories\u2014technology development,\nmanufacturing facility shells, and advanced production tools\u2014as we aim to catch up with our leading third-party manufacturing competitor on process technology, get to \"shell\nahead\" for our and potential future foundry customer needs, and adopt EUV lithography for our leading process nodes. In 2024, our manufacturing capital expenditures, inclusive\nof technology development, were distributed 55% in manufacturing facility space and 45% in equipment.\nTo moderate the impact to our balance sheet and cash flows, we\u2019ve implemented what we call Smart Capital. Smart Capital includes maintaining a \"shell ahead\" on the longer", "lead time space and delaying tool purchases as long as possible ahead of high confidence demand signals while leveraging capital offsets from governments, financial partners,\nand customers.\nWe work closely with governments in the regions where we operate to obtain government incentives to support leading-edge semiconductor R&D and manufacturing in those\nregions. Such incentives are often needed to offset the higher costs of operations in such regions, and support a more geographically balanced and risk-tolerant semiconductor\nsupply chain. We worked closely with the US federal government on the implementation of the CHIPS Act in support of the semiconductor industry and American technological\nleadership and innovation. In 2024, we signed an agreement with the US Federal Department of Commerce for the award of up to $7.9 billion in direct funding under the", "commercial CHIPS Act program, which is designed to support leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in the US, as well as an agreement under which we may receive up to\n$3 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS Act's Secure Enclave program, which is designed to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US\ngovernment. We also expect and have begun to benefit significantly from the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit, given that the significant portion of our R&D and\nmanufacturing investments are made in the United States.\nIn 2024, as part of our SCIP program, we entered into an arrangement with Apollo in which we received a one-time capital infusion in exchange for an interest in the rights to\noperate Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland. This follows our first SCIP agreement, with Brookfield, completed in 2022 and relating to our Arizona facility expansion. In total, we expect\ngreater than $25 billion of capital offsets through these partnerships.", "greater than $25 billion of capital offsets through these partnerships.\nFinally, as we build out our external foundry services, we expect to receive customer pre-payments to secure capacity and other benefits. Customer pre-payments are a standard\npractice for semiconductor manufacturers.\nSupply Chain\nOur supply chain is a cornerstone of our success and a critical enabler of our mission to deliver cutting-edge technology solutions to our customers. Our global supply chain\nsupports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and operations, and sales and marketing. It encompasses thousands of\nsuppliers worldwide, forming a robust supply ecosystem designed to enable product and process competitiveness, deliver industry-leading total cost of ownership, and enable\non-time, uninterrupted supply in a responsible and sustainable manner.", "on-time, uninterrupted supply in a responsible and sustainable manner.\nOur global supply chain strategy is focused on driving a resilient, diverse, and responsible supply chain that meets the needs of our customers while upholding the highest\nstandards of safety, quality, technology, availability, and sustainability. We work tirelessly across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and optimize\ncapacity utilization and output to meet customer expectations.\nOur Capital 9\nHuman Capital\nOur human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success.

Refer\nalso to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.\nWe are in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological, geopolitical, and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in\ncustomer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these\ndevelopments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified in", "recent years, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future, including as a result of the proliferation of AI and high demand for AI-related products and services. If we are not\nable to compete effectively, or if our foundry strategy is unsuccessful, our financial results will be adversely affected, including through reduced revenue and gross margin, and\nwe may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\nWe face intense competition across our product portfolio. Our competitors include companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such\nas GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products;\nconnectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms,", "such as the ARM architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application\ndevelopers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products and the ARM ecosystem have seen increased development and adoption in\nrecent years. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these\ncustomers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020,\nApple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from\nApple's products and ecosystem.", "Apple's products and ecosystem.\nMost of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as TSMC or Samsung, for the manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products.\nManufacturing process and assembly and test improvements introduced by such foundries have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings\nby our competitors. Our process technology roadmap to regain transistor performance and power performance competitiveness is subject to a number of risks, and we could fail\nto realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and the\nrisks described in the risk factor \"The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and", "uncertainties.\" As an integrated device manufacturer, we have higher capital expenditures and R&D spending than many of our fabless competitors due to the high ongoing\ninvestments required to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry\nparticipants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive\nposition. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.\nOur products compete based on a number of factors, including performance, energy efficiency, ease-of-integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload", "optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer\nsupport and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. To the extent our products do not meet our customers'\nrequirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operations can be harmed. For example, we have lost market share in\nrecent years as competitors have introduced highly competitive data center and client platform products. Our data center business has been further negatively impacted by the\nshift of customer spend toward GPUs in the past few years. Additionally, to the extent we rely upon third party foundries for our products, our margins may be negatively\nimpacted, as has been the case with the Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors launched in September 2024.", "We have limited experience in the highly competitive and capital-intensive third-party foundry business. As we pursue our strategy to establish Intel Foundry as a major provider\nof foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, we will face intense competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries\n(GF), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). To succeed, we will need to compete effectively across\nfactors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and\ndensity; multi-chip packaging; system integration; manufacturing capacity; price; margin; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Building and\nmaintaining a competitive foundry business requires significant\nRisk Factors and Other Key Information 31\nTable of Contents", "Risk Factors and Other Key Information 31\nTable of Contents\nongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer\ncommitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability\nto make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have\nadditional project delays or project cancellations in the future. Moreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products\ncompete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality information, intellectual property, and foundry", "capacity, among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain\ntalented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and\nenvironmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or\nupgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand\ncapacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages,", "and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays\nand increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly\nuncertain.\nWe are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a\nfavorable return.\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make\nsignificant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&D efforts and capital investments we require are", "intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We\nincurred R&D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including process and\npackaging technology, our xPU products and features, AI, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process\ntechnologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not\ncontribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or", "technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process\ntechnology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely\nintroduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as\noptimizations for AI and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face\ncost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as", "a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to\ncustomer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor would be delayed from the\nfirst half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance\nper watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a", "disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by\nadvanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of\nadvanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing\ndisaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different\nmanufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utilization of more\nadvanced and expensive capital equipment.", "advanced and expensive capital equipment.\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical levels.\nIn recent years, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utilizing leading\nprocess technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV and high-NA EUV lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our\nneed to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that\nare fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D,", "and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product\ninvestments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our\ngross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and\nother unfavorable market factors. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make\ncapital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to", "write off inventory or record excess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is\nprolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our\nexpenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we\nrecorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the\nIntel 7 process node.\nRisk Factors and Other Key Information 32\nTable of Contents\nThe development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and\nuncertainties.", "uncertainties.\nWe are continually engaged in the development of next-generation technologies. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies\nis challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials\nor new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our\nreceipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially anticipated.\nWe are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing", "our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior\nexpectations.

These delays have allowed competitors\nusing third-party foundries, such as TSMC, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including improvements in performance, energy\nefficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. On the product side, we have had limited market success with our accelerator\nofferings, and in 2024 we recognized $922 million in Gaudi AI accelerator inventory-related charges. We may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of\nfurther delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products or lack of market success with our offerings.", "Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging\ntechnologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-\ngeneration process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D\ninvestments, particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our\nmanufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses, as we were required to do in the third quarter of 2024 with respect to the Intel 7 process node.", "Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing\nthroughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production\ntiming delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships.\nFurthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products,\nmanufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes,", "can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared\nto a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. In\naddition, the cost of new leading-edge process nodes continues to increase at a higher rate relative to legacy process nodes due to a number of factors, including the cost of\nprocuring and operating advanced manufacturing equipment. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have increased the number of\ntransistors per die, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also\ncontribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products.", "Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different\nprocess technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in\nsufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some\ncomponents pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the\npackaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to\nmanage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.", "From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses; interruptions in our supply of\nmaterials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents,\nmaintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions\u2014all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could\nresult in production timing delays.

To the\nextent demand shifts from our higher-margin to lower-margin products in any of our market segments, as has been the case with the Intel Core Ultra 200V processors, our gross\nmargin percentage has decreased and may decrease again.\nMacroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including changes to trade policies and regulations, present\nsignificant risks to us in many jurisdictions.\nWe have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic", "areas. Our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed, and with reliance in some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more\ngeographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US accounted for 76% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, with revenue from billings to China\ncontributing 29% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, assemble and test,\ndesign, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.\nAdverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy;", "high interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence\nand spending. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and\nmake business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to: increased credit and\ncollectability risks; higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets; reduced liquidity; adverse impacts on our suppliers; failures of counterparties,\nincluding financial institutions and insurers; asset impairments; and declines in the value of our financial instruments.", "Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing\ncosts, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials,\nor impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations,\ndomestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. They can also\nresult in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with\nus. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term\nRisk Factors and Other Key Information 35", "Risk Factors and Other Key Information 35\nTable of Contents\nchanges in global trade and technology supply chains, domestic sourcing initiatives, and decoupling of global trade networks, which could make it more difficult to sell our\nproducts in, or restrict our access to, some markets and have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.\nIn particular, geopolitical and trade tensions between the US and China, one of our largest markets, have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable\nto some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. Further, the US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to\ncertain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. Specifically, in 2022 the US significantly increased US export controls on semiconductor", "manufacturing equipment and on AI and advanced computing products. In 2023, the US added to the restrictions in all three areas and also worked with Japan and the\nNetherlands to align on additional restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In 2024, the US Commerce Department further expanded export controls to limit the\nglobal distribution of high-performance integrated circuits by restricting sales through customer allocations and imposing per-country caps. During this time, the US has\nincreasingly added Chinese companies to prohibited lists. In response, China has restricted US access to certain minerals and has blocked certain companies that provide\nproducts to Taiwan's military from selling products in China. These restrictions have in some instances reduced our sales and in a number of instances required specific", "governmental authorizations or exceptions. These and potential future restrictions, including also through application of antitrust laws and restrictions based on cybersecurity and\nother national security concerns, could adversely affect our financial performance and result in reputational harm to us. In addition, a number of semiconductor companies in\nChina, including SMIC, are making significant investments, in many instances with the support of the Chinese government, in advanced semiconductor technologies to enable\nsuch companies to develop products and technologies that compete with ours. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, whether the 2025\nchange in US administration may heighten tensions, the extent to which we may be able to mitigate the effects of any trade-related actions, and the longer-term implications of\ntrade-related actions on the market opportunities for us and the competition we may face.", "trade-related actions on the market opportunities for us and the competition we may face.\nGeopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, present significant risks to our\nglobal operations. For example:\n\u25aa There has been a significant escalation in tensions and hostilities affecting or in close proximity to Israel, where we have a leading-edge fabrication facility and multiple\nproduct development centers. As a significant portion of our revenues are generated from products on Intel 7 manufactured at our fabrication facility in Israel and we are\nnot insured for business interruptions, a disruption of that facility could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our property, plant, and\nequipment assets in Israel are self-insured and could be impacted by the conflict. Further, our Mobileye business is headquartered and has most of its operations in", "Israel and could be similarly impacted.\n\u25aa Tensions between mainland China and Taiwan have increased significantly in recent years, presenting an elevated risk of hostilities. Many of our products and all of our\nmore advanced products depend on suppliers in Taiwan for critical components, including various compute die, that cannot be easily or quickly replaced. Other of our\nproducts, including some of our most recently introduced products, are made entirely in Taiwan. As such, any disruption impacting Taiwan could significantly and\nadversely impact our ability to obtain critical components and supply our customers with products.\n\u25aa Russia\u2019s ongoing conflict with Ukraine has resulted in the imposition of financial and other sanctions and export controls against Russia and Belarus that has caused us\nand other companies to limit or suspend Russian operations (we had no exports to Russia in 2023 and 2024). The conflict has also resulted in Russia-imposed currency", "restrictions and regulations and other retaliatory trade and other actions, increased supply, commodity, and other costs, and an increased risk of cyberattacks.\nWe can also be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:\n\u25aa severe weather events and natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and other catastrophic events;\n\u25aa inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions, materials shortages or delays, and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of\nservices from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;\n\u25aa formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export\nlicenses, which could be changed without notice;", "licenses, which could be changed without notice;\n\u25aa government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from or distribute compensation or\nother funds in a particular country;\n\u25aa adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives provided to competitors;\n\u25aa differing employment practices and labor issues, including restricted access to talent;\n\u25aa ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n\u25aa local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;\n\u25aa continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and\n\u25aa fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, and in the capital and credit markets, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit", "deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.\nWe are subject to numerous risks associated with the evolving market for products with AI capabilities.\nThe markets and use cases for products with AI capabilities have been rapidly evolving, are difficult to predict, and may impact demand for our products.

They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business,\ncompetitive position, results of operations, and financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain\ntheir demand for our products. During the past several years, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as outbreaks of COVID-19, caused supply chain disruptions\nand delays in obtaining tools and other components, and the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available\nfoundry manufacturing capacity. These shortages have previously limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, and have adversely affected", "customer demand for our products, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce\nfinished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortages when they occur.\nTo obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have entered into arrangements with\nsome of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. These arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements, or our\nsuppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements\nfalls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some\ncases may not be fully recoverable.", "cases may not be fully recoverable.\nWe utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply a number of our products and components necessary for our products that we manufacture.\nAs part of our strategy, we expect to continue to rely upon third-party foundries. Delays in the development of foundries' future manufacturing processes could delay the\nintroduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand. We typically have less\ncontrol over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by\nthird parties.\nWhere possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain products, components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited", "number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, which can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. For example,\nASML Holding N.V. (ASML) is currently the sole supplier of EUV lithography tools that we are deploying in our Intel 4 and subsequent leading-edge manufacturing process\nnodes. These tools are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development\nand availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge\nmanufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. Some of our most advanced current and future products are or will be either exclusively\nmanufactured by TSMC or reliant upon critical components, including various compute die, manufactured by TSMC.", "We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues.\nFrom time to time, we identify product defects, errata, and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and\ntest processes.

Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We face\nrisks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product\ndefects or errata.

As described in \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings,", "excessive verdicts, or other events have occurred and could occur again, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions stopping us from manufacturing or selling\ncertain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming,\ndisruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and distracting to management.\nWe must attract, retain, and motivate key talent.\nWe believe that hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical talent, sales representatives, and other professionals are critical to our business. The", "competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense, with the demand often exceeding supply. Competitors for technical talent often seek to hire our employees, and\nthe availability of flexible, hybrid, or work-from-home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit\nthe pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. From time to time, we have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent,\nsuch as during 2021 and the first half of 2022, and these efforts have increased our expenses. Further, we may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the\nworkforce necessary to deliver on our strategy, and we have been required to curtail our planned hiring and reduce our workforce to respond to business conditions that have", "differed from our expectations, which can be disruptive, adversely impact employee morale, compromise our ability to deliver on our strategy and workforce goals, and impact our\nability to recruit in the future. For example, we undertook significant headcount reductions in 2022 and 2024. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use\nshare-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to our\ncompetitors have reduced the retention value of our share-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation. To the extent our compensation programs\nand workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, or changes in our workforce and related restructuring, reduction-in-force, or other initiatives are not viewed favorably, our", "ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees can be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, significant or prolonged turnover may negatively\nimpact our operations and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the loss of historical, technical, and other\nexpertise.\nChanges in our management team can also disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, given the long development cycle for semiconductor process\ntechnologies and products and the large capital investments over a long time period required for semiconductor manufacturing operations. We have had a number of changes in\nour senior leadership team in recent years, including our CEO and other senior management positions. For example, in December 2024, our most recent CEO retired after less", "than four years with the company and a search is currently underway for a new CEO. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees and\nleadership, our business may be harmed.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions and investments.\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks,\nincluding:\n\u25aa our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;\n\u25aa failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;\n\u25aa disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;\n\u25aa failure of partners to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely;\n\u25aa our inability to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding a project, property, or entity;", "\u25aa failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, or at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals on a timely basis or without materially\nburdensome conditions or mandated acquisitions, divestitures, or disposals, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or\nother unforeseen factors;\n\u25aa our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, such as the $2.9 billion charge we\nrecorded in the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to Mobileye goodwill, and restructuring charges;\n\u25aa our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;\n\u25aa our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority-owned businesses or our difficulty in integrating or separating employees, business systems, and technology", "or otherwise operating the acquired or majority-owned business;\n\u25aa controls, processes, and procedures of acquired or majority-owned businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations and create\ncomplexity and inconsistency in application of controls, processes and procedures, and our failure to identify and/or address compliance issues, including accounting or\ntax errors, or liabilities;\n\u25aa our inability to resolve impasses or disputes with partners, including as a result of differences in our interests or goals;\nRisk Factors and Other Key Information 41\nTable of Contents\n\u25aa our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, accounting, tax, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets, majority-owned\nbusinesses, or novel transactions; and\n\u25aa the potential for our transactions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.", "Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition,\ndivestiture or partial divestiture, or several concurrent strategic transactions. Moreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs;\naccordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or otherwise investing our resources in a manner that\ncould help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives.\nWe are subject to sales-related risks.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties, such as distributors, value-added\nresellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand,", "provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a\nproduct, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or\nreplace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our\nproducts is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third\nparties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties often sell", "products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they may\nface financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Further, any violations of the Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business, including subjecting us to litigation or regulatory risk.\nFailure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nFrom time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized \"gray market.\" Our policies and procedures designed to keep our products away from the gray", "market may not be successful in achieving this objective. Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies,\nwhich at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products\nalso sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be substandard.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for 45% of our net revenue in 2024, 40%\nof our net revenue in 2023 and 42% of our net revenue in 2022. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the", "foreseeable future. The loss of key customers, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase\nthe volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nIndustry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers, particularly\nhyperscalers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent an increasingly demanding computing environment. The further\nconsolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration\nand customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance;", "energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be\neroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including serving cloud service provider\ncustomers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in the last few years.\nSome cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific\ncomputing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract\nhardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has", "also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads from their own internal data center\ninfrastructures to cloud service providers. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or\ncancellations may result in non-recoverable costs.\nRisk Factors and Other Key Information 42\nTable of Contents\nWe face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from both US and non-US governments associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our\nproducts and services, and we are seeking to increase our sales of products and services to governmental entities in the future. Government demand and payment are often\naffected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations, and can be", "adversely impacted by shutdowns of the US federal government and changes in US administration, including administrative priorities. Government contracts are subject to\nprocurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example,\ncertain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, customers, and/or\nemployees, and failure or inability to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or\ndebarment from future business with the US government.\nWe face risks related to our debt obligations.\nWe have incurred significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including our ability to fully implement our strategy. As of", "December 28, 2024, we had $51.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and other borrowings outstanding. In addition, we have a commercial paper\nprogram of up to $10.0 billion and credit facilities to backstop these programs and otherwise provide access to committed capital of up to $15.0 billion. As we continue to pursue\nour strategy, we expect to incur additional indebtedness, refinance our existing debt, and issue additional notes or other debt securities in the future at a variety of interest rates,\nmaturities, and terms. The semiconductor industry is a cyclical business and our revenue, cash flows, and outlook often fluctuate in accordance with this cycle, as well as\nprevailing macroeconomic conditions, our business strategy, and other risks described in these risk factors. These fluctuations, together with our debt level and related debt", "service obligations, could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing the risk of a\nfuture downgrade in our credit ratings that can impact the value of our outstanding debt and increase our borrowing costs. During 2024 and in prior years, we suffered multiple\ncredit rating downgrades that adversely impacted our borrowing costs and access to capital, and we may continue to suffer additional such downgrades if our business and\nfinancial results do not measurably improve. We may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, debt\nrefinancing, future acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, which will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing", "market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which\ncould adversely impact our ability to finance our business strategy and service and repay outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due, all of which could adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition, and the cost of borrowing.\nWe have ceased to return capital to stockholders.\nIn recent years, we have not made repurchases of our stock and reduced, and then suspended in the fourth quarter of 2024, our quarterly dividend. Further, we agreed under our\ncommercial CHIPS Act agreement to forgo paying dividends for the next two years, and agreed to limitations on the payment of dividends for the three years thereafter. There\ncan be no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends in the future. In addition, we are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program and there can", "be no assurances as to the amount, timing, and execution of any future share repurchases, or that any repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nLaws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business.\nWe are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions and affect our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP\nownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy and localization\nrequirements; competition; advertising; employment and labor; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such\nrequirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and", "regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology and MaaS may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations\nfor our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data-protection measures could adversely affect our customers and\ntheir products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.\nOur policies, controls, and procedures designed to help provide for compliance with applicable laws cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or\nagents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees;", "prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can\nincrease our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.\nWe are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in US dollars, operating expenses and capital\nexpenditures may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the US\nwhere we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as non-US dollar capital", "expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of\nthe adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Factors and Other Key Information 43\nTable of Contents\nChanges in our effective tax rate may impact our net income.\nA number of factors can impact our future effective tax rate or cash payments, which could cause significant variability in our financial results, including:\n\u25aa changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;\n\u25aa changes in our business or legal entity operating model;\n\u25aa the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;\n\u25aa changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;", "\u25aa adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n\u25aa increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n\u25aa changes in available tax credits, including non-US tax credits, R&D credits, and refundable tax credits;\n\u25aa expirations or changes in our ability to secure new tax holidays and incentives;\n\u25aa changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including the global implementation of a minimum tax under Pillar Two of the OECD BEPS\ninitiative;\n\u25aa changes in US GAAP and non-US IFRS; and\n\u25aa our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for incremental taxes, including any local country withholding taxes incurred upon\nrepatriation.\nCatastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.", "Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nOur operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by: severe weather events and natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health\nissues and global pandemics such as COVID-19; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation restrictions or disruptions, telecommunications, or IT\nsystems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; geopolitical conflict; terrorism; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our\nmanufacturing processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including cybersecurity\nincidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global", "climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could\ndisrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities, including our facilities located in water-sensitive regions such as Arizona and Israel. In\naddition, to the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be harmed. In recent years, the west coast of the US has\nexperienced significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities, and in California, where we are headquartered. The long-term effects of\nclimate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear but could be severe.\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, safety, and product regulations.", "We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, safety, and product regulations.\nThe design, manufacturing, assembly, and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to a broad array of environmental,\nhealth, and safety laws and regulations. Our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict\nminerals), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and use of our real\nproperty. The scope and interpretation of such laws and regulations, including the materials they govern, are complex and continue to evolve. The procedures and processes in\nplace under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and cannot guarantee compliance by employees or third parties to whom such", "laws apply. The amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations, as well as our failure or inability to comply with them (including as a result of acquired entities), can result\nin regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; increased costs; additional remediation obligations; suspension of production; alteration, suspension, or termination of our\nmanufacturing and assembly and test processes, including due to an inability to find, afford, or attain adequate substitute materials, equipment, or processes; damage to our\nreputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, the failure or inability to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our\nproduction processes and sources, and result in increased risks and costs.\nThe failure or inability by us, our customers, or our suppliers to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can", "lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, including with respect to the materials and processes we are permitted to use and as to air quality and\nwastewater requirements, may impede our ability to manufacture products or expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations\nsometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, cease the use of a particular material or process, remove or\nremediate hazardous substances, or incur other expenses or liabilities. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with\nair pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas", "emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment,\npurchase carbon offsets, and/or alter, where feasible, our production processes and sources. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy\ncosts, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. Regulations in response to human health concerns may also limit or prohibit the use of a class of\nchemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are found in parts, components, process chemicals, and other materials used in semiconductor\nmanufacturing. Such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many semiconductor products and there are limited\nRisk Factors and Other Key Information 44\nTable of Contents", "Risk Factors and Other Key Information 44\nTable of Contents\ntechnically and commercially feasible alternatives. As we expand our manufacturing capacity, the impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we\nare evaluating for use in our operations are also subject to regulation under environmental laws. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by\nincreasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.\nOur initiatives and new legal requirements with respect to corporate responsibility matters present various risks.\nOur corporate responsibility initiatives could expose us to heightened scrutiny and numerous financial, legal, reputational, operational, compliance, and other risks, including lost\ncustomer opportunities, which could negatively impact us. Our achievement of initiatives, aspirations, and goals related to corporate responsibility matters, including those related", "to sustainability, is not guaranteed and is subject to numerous conditions, risks, and expectations, as well as standards, processes, and methodologies that continue to evolve.\nFurther, any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders' evolving expectations could also negatively impact us.\nIn addition, we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate-related and other sustainability laws and regulations, including, for example, the state of\nCalifornia's new climate change disclosure requirements, the EU's new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and the SEC's recently adopted climate-change disclosure\nrequirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations, as well as the overall increased focus and scrutiny from regulators, investors, customers, vendors, employees, and", "other stakeholders concerning ESG and climate matters, could impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks, including resulting in changes to our current ESG\ngoals.\nSales and Marketing\nCustomers\nWe design, market, sell, and service CPUs and other semiconductor solutions substantially through our Intel Products business that are manufactured by our Intel Foundry\nbusiness and other suppliers and are incorporated in computing and related end products and services, and utilized globally by consumers, enterprises, governments, and\neducational organizations. We sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and\nunbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers", "and cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For information on customers who accounted for\ngreater than 10% of our consolidated net revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers\u2014systems builders that purchase Intel processors and other products from our distributors.\nCertain of our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.\nSales Arrangements\nOur products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard\nterms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright", "indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or\nno notice to us and without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and\nconditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow customers to\nreview inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer\ndiscounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.\nIn accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our", "facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due\nat a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit\nlimits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.\nCredit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay.\nDistribution\nDistributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly\nwith us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.\nRisk Factors and Other Key Information 45", "Risk Factors and Other Key Information 45\nTable of Contents\nSeasonal Trends\nHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth\nquarter. In 2024 and 2023, our net revenue seasonality was directionally consistent with this historical trend. In 2022, we had a flatter trend than we historically observe as we\nexperienced the uncertainty and impacts, including demand volatility and supply chain disruption, of macroeconomic conditions, the potential for a recession, and the risk for\ncontinued COVID-19-related disruptions or shutdowns.\nMarketing\nOur global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers,", "and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The\nIntel Core processor family and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year we introduced our new Intel Core Ultra processors, powering the latest AI PCs,\nand our Intel Xeon 6 processors, built with AI acceleration in every core. Our foundry services business aims to offer leading-edge packaging and process technology,\ngeographically balanced manufacturing capacity, and a world-class IP portfolio.\nIn addition to bringing new products to market in 2024, we focus on building brand awareness and driving demand through our own direct marketing and co-marketing programs\nwith partners. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer", "communications, and public relations. We market to consumer and commercial audiences. Our key messaging reinforces the Intel brand pillars of exceptionally engineered,\ncollaboratively innovative, and responsibly built, while emphasizing our ability to bring AI everywhere across data center, cloud, edge, and PC.\nCertain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands\nbeyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel\u00ae logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor\ntechnologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to\ncustomers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations.", "Risk Factors and Other Key Information 46\nTable of Contents\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may\nnot eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 28, 2024\nand December 30, 2023. Actual results may differ materially.\nCurrency Exchange Rates\nWe are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-US-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments, and may economically hedge these risks with foreign\ncurrency contracts, such as currency forward contracts, currency swaps, or interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-US-currency investments are generally offset by\ncorresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.", "corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. However, a portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the\nIsraeli shekel, the Malaysian ringgit, the European Union euro, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect\nagainst currency exchange rate risks associated with non-US-dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-US-dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge\ncurrency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts\nin these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse", "change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting\nrecorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less\nthan $54 million and less than $53 million, respectively.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and\nprovide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track SOFR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our\nfixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into SOFR-based returns. We also entered into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into", "floating-rate coupon payments for a portion of our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the\nrelated hedging instruments.\nA hypothetical change in benchmark interest rates of 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our investment\nportfolio of less than $100 million as of December 28, 2024 and as of December 30, 2023.\nTaking into account fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of\napproximately $120 million from debt outstanding as of December 28, 2024 ($120 million from debt outstanding as of December 30, 2023).\nEquity Prices\nWe are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities.", "As of December 28, 2024, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $0.8 billion ($1.2 billion as of December 30, 2023). The substantial majority of our marketable\nequity securities portfolio as of December 28, 2024 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board.\nTo determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio.\nAssuming a decline of 55% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by $466 million, based on the value as of December 28,\n2024 (a decrease in value of $418 million, based on the value as of December 30, 2023 using an assumed decline of 35%).\nWe utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 31, 2025\nAuditor's Reports 56\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nYears

Statements\nNote 1 : Basis of Presentation\nWe have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were 52-week fiscal years; 2022 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal\n2025 is a 52-week fiscal year. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which include entities\nconsolidated under the variable interest and voting interest models. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions.\nWe made certain reclassifications within our Consolidated Financial Statements during 2024, and, in certain cases, adjusted prior periods to conform to the current period\npresentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income (loss), cash flows, or stockholders' equity.\nUse of Estimates", "Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.\nEffective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years. When compared to the estimated useful life in\nplace as of the end of 2022, we estimated this change increased gross margin in 2023 by approximately $2.5 billion and decreased R&D expense by approximately $400 million.\nAs of December 30, 2023, we estimated this change decreased ending inventory values by approximately $1.3 billion. These estimates were based on the assets in use and\nunder construction as of the beginning of 2023 and were calculated at that point in time.\nNote 2 : Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition", "Note 2 : Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of\nour revenue is derived from product sales. Our products often include a software component, such as firmware, that is highly interdependent and interrelated with the product\nand is substantially accounted for as a combined performance obligation. In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone\nproduct sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms.\nWe measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as", "an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of\nconsideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their\nreceivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued liabilities.\nWe make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We generally record the payment as a\nreduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as an expense when the marketing activities occur.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment", "Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures.\nCapitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated over the estimated useful life.\nAt least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant, and equipment, considering factors such as the process\ntechnology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process\ntechnology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding", "the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets\nare shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives. Effective January 2023, the estimated useful\nlives of certain machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years. This change in estimate was applied prospectively beginning in the\nfirst quarter of 2023.\nFinancial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 62\nTable of Contents\nAssets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review\ninclude significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or", "planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If the carrying value of an asset grouping is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset\ngrouping is considered to be impaired.\nIdentified Intangible Assets\nWe amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. We perform periodic reviews of significant finite-lived identified\nintangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors,\nincluding external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines.\nPeriodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the", "remaining periods of amortization. We may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized to reflect the period over which they are expected to contribute to our cash\nflows.\nGoodwill\nOur reporting units substantially align with our operating segments. We reevaluate our identified reporting units annually or when triggered, such as upon reorganization of our\noperating segments. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of\npotential impairment exist. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment assessment represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain\ncorporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. The impairment assessment may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of\nan impairment.", "an impairment.\nQualitative factors used include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. We may also\nperform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.\nOur quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. Significant estimates include\nmarket segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated gross margins, operating expenses, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted\naverage cost of capital. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. These estimates change", "from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of the fair value and potential goodwill impairment\nfor each reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying estimates and assumptions, the most sensitive of which is the discount rate.\nInventories\nWe compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering\nmilestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of\nsales can be capitalized as inventory.\nFor a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. We have", "identified the start of manufacturing volume for sale to customers as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory.\nPrior to the start of manufacturing volume for sale to customers, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred.\nThe valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and\nassembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity to determine our expectations of normal capacity level. If the factory loading\nis below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as", "cost of sales in that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were $174 million in 2024, $834 million in 2023, and $423 million in\n2022.\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances\nreviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling\nprice in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies, with costs generally improving over time\ndue to scale and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing environment.", "The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use a demand forecast to develop\nour short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when\ndeveloping these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of\nobsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off\namounts considered to be excess inventory.\nFinancial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 63\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Incentives", "Table of Contents\nGovernment Incentives\nGovernment incentives, including cash grants and refundable tax credits, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received and we will\ncomply with the conditions specified in the agreement or statutory requirements. We record capital-related incentives as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment, net within\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating-related\nincentives as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to compensate.\nFair Value\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use", "when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative, equity method investments, certain other receivables, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-\nincome investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\u25aa Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n\u25aa Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations.", "All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant\ninputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When\nwe use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed\npricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n\u25aa Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs", "and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset and liability\nclasses. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, non-binding broker quotes, and probability-weighted outcomes that we are unable to corroborate\nwith observable market data.\nEquity Investments\nWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:\n\u25aa Marketable equity investments are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether\nrealized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement.\n\u25aa Non-marketable equity investments are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities", "at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.\n\u25aa Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method\ninvestments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The\ncarrying value of our non-marketable equity investments is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an\norderly transaction by the same issuer.

Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the\nfair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches.\nFinancial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 64\nTable of Contents\n\u25aa Non-marketable equity investments are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and property, plant, and equipment. Upon\ndetermining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value, and an impairment is recognized immediately if the\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value.", "carrying value exceeds the fair value.\n\u25aa Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a\ndecline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery.\nImpairments of non-marketable equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nOur primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk,\ncommodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with", "the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain\nderivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized\nfor derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross\nbasis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.\nCash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency swaps, to hedge exposures for variability in the US-dollar equivalent of non-US-dollar-\ndenominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending.", "denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending.\nThe after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified\ninto earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the\nimpact of the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are\nrecognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable,\nthe corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with", "these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.\nFair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to\nchanges in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying\nhedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are\nclassified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within net cash provided by (used for) financing activities.", "Non-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, and\nnon-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as hedged investments. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-dollar-\ndenominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as hedged investments. The change in fair value of non-designated derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets\nand liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives.\nDebt Investments", "Debt Investments\nDebt investments include investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities of\napproximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities at the date of\npurchase greater than approximately three months and all economically hedged debt investments are classified as short-term investments, as they represent the investment of\ncash available for current operations.\nFor certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument, or the marketable debt investment itself is\nused to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value.

Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with\nunrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of the investment sold at the individual security level\nand record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.\nFinancial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 65\nTable of Contents\nUnhedged debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists by considering", "information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance\nfor credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be\nrequired or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest and other, net,\nand unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nCredit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, reverse", "repurchase agreements, and trade and other receivables. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit\nexposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments\nin debt instruments are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Due to master\nnetting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations", "exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 28, 2024, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in US\ntreasury and US agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $1.4 billion. To further reduce credit risk,\nwe enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure collateral from counterparties against obligations, including\nsecurities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements is included in other current assets, other long-\nterm assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an\nasset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.", "asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.\nA substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and\ncommunications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers\n(47% as of December 28, 2024) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience.\nWe have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our\nmajor customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will", "seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe have economic interests in entities that are VIEs. If we conclude we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we are required to consolidate the entity in our financial\nstatements. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic\nperformance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our evaluation includes identification of\nsignificant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide services to the VIE. Periodically, we", "assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of majority-owned subsidiaries consolidated under the variable interest and voting interest models. Non-controlling\ninterests represent the portion of equity not attributable to Intel and are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax and transaction costs, on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for majority-owned subsidiaries are attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders on our\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on respective ownership percentages. We account for changes in", "ownership of our majority-owned subsidiaries as equity transactions when we retain a controlling financial interest.\nFinancial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 66\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition.\nThis allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining the fair value of the following:\n\u25aa inventory; property, plant, and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration; each as may be applicable;\n\u25aa intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment\nshare, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;", "share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;\n\u25aa deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; and\n\u25aa goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\nOur assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies.\nThese assumptions and estimates are used to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to\nbenefit from the business combination. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may recognize adjustments to the\nassets acquired, liabilities assumed, and related goodwill.\nEmployee Equity Incentive Plans", "assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and related goodwill.\nEmployee Equity Incentive Plans\nWe use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise,\ncancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for\neach vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award.\nFor the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay\nin cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition,", "the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.\nIncome Taxes\nWe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or\nsettled.\nWe assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation", "allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans\nwith respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on\nexamination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50%\nlikely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for (benefit from) taxes on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.", "Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and\nwithholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely\nreinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working\ncapital and investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions\ncould require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-US income and withholding taxes.\nLeases", "Leases\nLeases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise\nsuch options. For leases for supplier capacity, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. For all other leases, we account for the lease\nand non-lease components separately and do not include the non-lease components in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be fixed or\nvariable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.\nFinancial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 67\nTable of Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in", "connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business and are subject to change, including\ndue to sudden or rapid developments in proceedings or claims. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has\nbeen incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make\nadjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or\nmore of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected.\nNote 3 : Operating Segments", "adversely affected.\nNote 3 : Operating Segments\nWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between\nour Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI, and NEX) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and\nrelated solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing,\ntest, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utilize marketing, sales, and other support functions.\nOur internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on", "costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate Altera as a standalone business. Altera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and,\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" As a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new\noperating model. All prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our\noperating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.\nWe organize our business as follows:\n\u25aa Intel Products:\n\u25aa Client Computing Group (CCG)\n\u25aa Data Center and AI (DCAI)\n\u25aa Network and Edge (NEX)\n\u25aa Intel Foundry\n\u25aa All other:\n\u25aa Altera\n\u25aa Mobileye\n\u25aa Other", "\u25aa Network and Edge (NEX)\n\u25aa Intel Foundry\n\u25aa All other:\n\u25aa Altera\n\u25aa Mobileye\n\u25aa Other\nCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX, Altera, and Mobileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected\nto disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.\nThe accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and\noperating margin is as follows:\nIntel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX\n\u25aa Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived\nfrom our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package,\nwhich are based on Intel architecture.", "which are based on Intel architecture.\n\u25aa Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing\nexpenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.\nFinancial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 68\nTable of Contents\nIntel Foundry\n\u25aa Segment revenue: Consists substantially of intersegment product and services revenue for wafer fabrication, substrates and other related products, and services sold to\nIntel Products, Altera, and certain other Intel internal businesses. We recognize intersegment revenue based on the completion of performance obligations. Product revenue\nis recognized upon transfer of ownership, which is generally at the completion of wafer sorting. Backend service revenue is recognized upon the completion of assembly and", "test milestones, which approximates the recognition of revenue over the service period. Intersegment sales are recorded at prices that are intended to approximate market\npricing. Intel Foundry also includes certain third-party foundry and assembly and test revenue from external customers that totaled $385 million in 2024, $953 million in 2023,\nand $474 million in 2022.\n\u25aa Segment expenses: Consists of direct expenses for technology development, product manufacturing and services provided by Intel Foundry to internal and external\ncustomers, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Direct expenses for product manufacturing include excess capacity charges.\nAll Other\nOur \"all other\" category includes the results of operations from other non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, including our Altera and Mobileye businesses, start-up", "businesses that support our initiatives, and historical results of operations from divested businesses. The financial results of our all other category include intersegment product\nand services revenue and intersegment expenses.\nWe allocate operating expenses from our sales and marketing group to the Intel Products operating segments and allocate operating expenses from our finance and\nadministration groups to all of our operating segments, except Mobileye.\nWe estimate that the substantial majority of our consolidated depreciation expense was incurred by Intel Foundry in 2024, 2023, and 2022. Intel Foundry depreciation expense is\nsubstantially included in overhead cost pools and then combined with other costs, and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through the manufacturing\nprocess and is sold to Intel Products or other customers. As a result, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each Intel", "Products operating segment's operating income (loss).\nWe do not allocate to our operating segments corporate operating expenses that primarily consist of:\n\u25aa restructuring and other charges;\n\u25aa share-based compensation;\n\u25aa certain impairment charges; and\n\u25aa certain acquisition-related adjustments, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.\nWe do not allocate to our operating segments non-operating items such as:\n\u25aa gains and losses from equity investments;\n\u25aa interest and other income; and\n\u25aa income taxes.\nOur interim Co-Chief Executive Officers are our CODMs. The CODMs primarily use operating income (loss) to evaluate each segment's performance and allocate resources.\nThis measure is utilized during our budgeting and forecasting process to assess profitability and enable decision making regarding strategic initiatives, capital investments, and", "personnel across all operating segments. While operating income (loss) is the primary measure used by our CODMs to allocate resources, they often review materials that\npresent operating segment gross margin. Accordingly, we have included gross margin as a secondary measure within the accompanying reconciliation of our operating segment\nand consolidated results. The measures regularly provided to and used by our CODMs under our new operating model continue to evolve; currently, our CODMs do not regularly\nreview or receive discrete asset information by operating segment.\nIntersegment eliminations: Intersegment sales and related gross margin on inventory recorded at the end of the period or sold through to third-party customers is eliminated\nfor consolidation purposes. The Intel Products operating segments and Intel Foundry are meant to reflect separate fabless semiconductor and foundry companies, respectively.", "Thus, certain intersegment activity is captured within the intersegment eliminations upon consolidation and presented at the Intel consolidated level. This activity primarily relates\nto inventory reserves, which are determined and recorded based on our accounting policies for Intel as a whole, but are only recorded by the Intel Products operating segments\nupon transfer of inventory from Intel Foundry.

Intel\nIn October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and\nprocessor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI sought damages, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. Intel prevailed on all\neight patents and the court entered final judgment in April 2024. VLSI appealed the Court's judgment of non-infringement as to one of the eight patents. In April 2019, VLSI filed", "three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had\nacquired from NXP:\n\u25aa The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of\nanother patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162 million\nin pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court's rejection of Intel's claim to have a\nlicense from Fortress Investment Group's acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2023, the Federal Circuit", "reversed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI was awarded $675 million. The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the patent\nfor which VLSI had been awarded $1.5 billion, but vacated the damages award and sent the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on that patent.\nThe Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI's patents. In December 2021 and January 2022 the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard (PTAB) instituted Inter Partes Reviews (IPR) on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and June 2023 found all of those\nclaims unpatentable; VLSI has appealed the PTAB's decisions. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that it is licensed to VLSI's patents. The motion remains\npending.", "pending.\n\u25aa The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged\ninfringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. In September 2024, the court denied VLSI's motion for a new trial. Other post-trial motions remain\npending, and the court has not yet entered final judgment.\n\u25aa The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI\napproximately $949 million in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new\ntrial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that", "it is licensed to VLSI's patents, and the court granted Intel's motion that same month. Trial on the license defense has been set for May 2025.\nIn May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu)\nCo., Ltd.

Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property\nAdministration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021 and September 2023. VLSI sought an injunction as well\nas RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the CNIPA invalidated every claim of the asserted patent. In November 2023, the trial court\ndismissed VLSI's case.", "dismissed VLSI's case.\nIn May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd.\nasserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an\ninjunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. In February 2024, the patent was found not invalid, and Intel appealed the decision in May\n2024. The appeal remains pending. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision finding no infringement and dismissing all claims.\nIn November 2023, VLSI appealed the finding of non-infringement to the Supreme People's Court. The Supreme People's Court held an evidentiary hearing in October 2024, and\na trial in November 2024.\nFinancial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 98\nTable of Contents", "Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 98\nTable of Contents\nIn July 2024, Intel filed suit against VLSI in US District Court for the District of Delaware requesting the court find Intel is licensed to VLSI's patents. In September 2024, VLSI filed\nmotions requesting that Intel's complaint be dismissed, transferred, or stayed.\nAs of December 28, 2024, we have accrued a charge of approximately $1.0 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI's claims and intend to vigorously defend\nagainst them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings.\nR2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation\nIn November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc.
