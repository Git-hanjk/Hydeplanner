leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping,\nthe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continued to pursue a technol-\nogy-focused strategy to drive rapid military modernization, expand\ninternal political surveillance and suppression of dissent, and assert\nChina\u2019s political and economic agenda in the international arena.\nAt the same time, amid a domestic property market collapse, weak\nconsumer demand, and rising debt and employment challenges, the\nParty leadership has aggressively continued to advance its econom-\nic, political, and security goals through non-market practices. Xi\nclearly has calculated that these approaches are not only paramount", "clearly has calculated that these approaches are not only paramount\nin defining his leadership and claiming China\u2019s global role, but are\nalso essential to addressing its endemic economic weaknesses and\nfurther tightening the Party\u2019s grip on the economy and society. The\ncentralized top-down approach is reminiscent of Mao-era authori-\ntarianism. With few remaining avenues for dissent and a political\nsystem that demands absolute loyalty to the individual leader, it has\nbecome unlikely that anyone could dissuade Xi should he decide to\ntake actions that risk igniting a catastrophic conflict.\nThe CCP\u2019s efforts to consolidate economic control are evident in\nnumerous ways: its systematic restriction of access to national fi-\nnancial and economic data as well as basic corporate data necessary\nfor due diligence and safety controls, security threats to foreigners\nengaged in business in China, persistent pressure on foreign gov-\nernment partners to conduct trade in renminbi, and the concentra-", "ernment partners to conduct trade in renminbi, and the concentra-\ntion of resources and support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\nAlthough Xi has consistently emphasized the importance of small\nand medium-sized enterprises in providing jobs and accelerating in-\nnovation, the data show that the CCP\u2019s post-COVID policies have\nstrengthened the position of SOEs. From June 2021 to June 2024,\nof the top 100 firms listed on Chinese exchanges, SOEs\u2019 share of\naggregate market capitalization grew to 54 percent, rising from $2.7\ntrillion to $3.2 trillion. Over the same period, non-public enterprises\u2019\nshare of market capitalization dropped to 33 percent and aggregate\nrevenue stagnated. While the increased flow of resources into SOEs\nmay serve the Party\u2019s short-term interests, other challenges remain.\nIn the past two years, Chinese universities have graduated record\nlevels of students who are finding the market offers jobs they do not\nwant or needs skills they do not have.", "want or needs skills they do not have.\nIgnoring the advice of many of his own economists and financial\nleaders, Xi has taken limited steps to open markets and boost con-\nsumer spending and confidence. Instead, China is reinforcing its\nlongstanding, market-distorting approach of massive subsidies to\ntargeted industries, this time focusing on high-tech manufacturing\nin order to unleash \u201cnew quality productive forces\u201d and generate\nmore earnings through its exports and traditional dumping ap-\n(1)\n2\nproaches. Designed to strengthen self-sufficiency and achieve global\ndominance in key sectors\u2014including but not limited to advanced\nand legacy semiconductor chips, aviation, advanced batteries, robot-\nics, and artificial intelligence\u2014China\u2019s strategy is also intended to\nintegrate it more deeply into global supply chains and continue to\nincrease every other country\u2019s dependence on it for a wide array of\ngoods and materials. As the United States and its partners move to", "goods and materials. As the United States and its partners move to\nfurther curb access to military and dual-use technologies and ad-\ndress China\u2019s blatant disregard for global norms and international\nagreements, China is shifting production overseas to circumvent re-\nstrictions while expanding its own access to critical minerals, mar-\nkets, key enabling technologies and tools, and labor. Because its sub-\nsidized goods undercut foreign competitors, China\u2019s approach comes\nat the expense of both advanced and emerging economies.\nIn 2024, the United States, Canada, and the EU have increased\nefforts to review both incoming and outgoing investment flows,\nstrengthen trade investigation and enforcement actions, and ap-\nply export controls and sanctions. The intensification of recent ef-\nforts reflects rising concern with Chinese predatory and debt-trap\npractices and control of resources essential to our defense capabil-\nities, along with expansion of China\u2019s dominance in multiple mar-", "ities, along with expansion of China\u2019s dominance in multiple mar-\nket sectors. Countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have also\nlaunched trade remedy investigations and imposed new tariffs on\nChinese imports. Nevertheless, these responses have been largely\nuncoordinated as individual countries and international institutions\nstruggle to address the scale of China\u2019s economy, its integration into\nglobal supply chains, and its defiance of WTO and other internation-\nal agreements and norms.\nChina has sought to strengthen its international position through\nbilateral coercion to secure economic, trade, and security agree-\nments with select countries and by manipulating international and\nregional institutions to win collective support of China\u2019s policy po-\nsitions. Of importance is China\u2019s aggressive and coercive effort to\nconvince other countries to adopt statements endorsing its positions\non Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and more. At the recent triennial Forum", "on Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and more. At the recent triennial Forum\non China-Africa Cooperation, representatives of 53 of the 55 African\nmembers adopted a declaration pledging to support \u201call efforts\u201d by\nChina to \u201creunify\u201d with Taiwan. According to the Chinese Loans to\nAfrica database released by the Boston University Global Develop-\nment Policy Center, at least 49 of the 53 signatories have received\nloan commitments from China or Chinese lenders.\nChina\u2019s quest for \u201cmultipolarization\u201d aims to create a world in\nwhich the United States and its democratic allies are weakened and\nconstrained, while states such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Ko-\nrea have free rein to threaten their neighbors and defy any notion of\nuniversally agreed-upon norms or a rules-based international order.\nIn 2024, NATO issued its strongest criticism of China to date, la-\nbeling it a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. China con-\ntinues to provide substantial support for Russia\u2019s war of aggression", "tinues to provide substantial support for Russia\u2019s war of aggression\nagainst Ukraine by exporting vital dual-use goods that power Rus-\nsia\u2019s military while shielding Russia\u2019s economy from international\nsanctions. Similarly, with respect to Iran, China\u2019s oil purchases\n3\nequate to about 90 percent of that country\u2019s government budget, en-\nabling Tehran to finance terrorist groups and other regional proxies.\nIn the Indo-Pacific, China\u2019s aggressive actions have expanded. In\naddition to launching its first intercontinental ballistic missile test\ninto the South Pacific in more than 40 years, China has engaged in\nlarge-scale military exercises around Taiwan that for the first time\ninvolved the China Coast Guard. It has pursued violent actions in\ncontravention of international law against Philippine vessels in an\nattempt to block the resupply to Second Thomas Shoal in the Phil-\nippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone. It has also increased the tempo of", "ippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone. It has also increased the tempo of\nincursions, the weapons onboard, and the number of ships entering\nwaters around the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands in the\nEast China Sea. These actions are part of a troubling and persistent\ntrend of escalation of pressure with the goal of asserting China\u2019s\nclaim of authority and control across the region. China\u2019s approach\nhas strengthened U.S. efforts to enhance security cooperation and\nbase access arrangements with allies and partners in the region.\nAs China continues to pursue its goal of displacing the United\nStates as the leading global power, Xi\u2019s consolidation of personal\nauthority has increased the risk of miscalculation and conflict. Xi\nhas attempted to compensate for China\u2019s poor economic performance\nby further strengthening his grip over the Party and the Party\u2019s grip\nover government, the military, and society. Xi continued to purge", "over government, the military, and society. Xi continued to purge\nhigh-level officials from the national security establishment and im-\nposed stricter disciplinary measures on rank-and-file Party mem-\nbers. In Hong Kong, through the imposition of a new national se-\ncurity ordinance, China has further quashed the city\u2019s once vibrant\ncivil society and increased the Mainland\u2019s control.\nLooking forward to 2025, even as China\u2019s economy falters, the\nCCP will continue to pursue its geopolitical ambitions, strengthen\nthe Party-state, attempt to \u201csanctions proof\u201d its financial position,\nand reduce Western leverage in the event of a conflict. A clearly co-\nordinated, U.S.-led effort to build a coalition of like-minded countries\nand more closely align trade and investment policies is an essen-\ntial step in responding to China\u2019s ambitions. The United States will\nneed to strengthen work with allies and partners to build consensus", "need to strengthen work with allies and partners to build consensus\ndomestically and internationally on the full range of policies needed\nto defend our shared interests and values from the threat posed by\nChina and its partners as they seek to increase their power, extend\ntheir reach, and reshape global norms to reflect the interests of their\nauthoritarian regimes.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPart I: The Year in Review\nChapter 1: U.S.-China Economic and Trade Relations (Year\nin Review)\nChina\u2019s economy grew in 2024, albeit at a much slower pace than\nit did pre-pandemic. Chinese officials have introduced stimulus mea-\nsures throughout the year, including a series of announcements in\nSeptember and October that will likely provide a short-term boost\nto economic growth. While the latest stimulus round has the po-\ntential to be among the largest China has passed to deal with the\ncurrent crisis, the measures are insufficient in scale compared to", "current crisis, the measures are insufficient in scale compared to\nthe scope of China\u2019s economic challenges, and their long-term im-\npact is questionable. The fallout from the property sector collapse\ncontinues to be China\u2019s largest domestic economic headwind and\na source of weakness for local government finances and consumer\nspending. Officials remain focused on mitigating systemic economic\nrisks and achieving a controlled deflation of the property bubble\nrather than reversing the sector\u2019s decline. Although Chinese policy-\nmakers have repeatedly stated their intention to increase the contri-\nbutions of services and consumption to economic growth, in reality,\nChina has doubled down on a variant of its traditional manufactur-\ning and export model. China has increased government subsidies\nand targeted supply-side stimulus toward favored industries, espe-\ncially those involving advanced technology. The Chinese Communist", "cially those involving advanced technology. The Chinese Communist\nParty\u2019s (CCP\u2019s) prioritization of supply-side policies aims to further\nstrengthen China\u2019s manufacturing base and increase its self-suffi-\nciency while simultaneously increasing Party-state control over do-\nmestic capital allocation and global supply chains and increasing\ndependency by other nations. While this strategy has led to China\u2019s\nemergence as a leader in the manufacture and export of goods such\nas solar panels and electric vehicles (EVs), China\u2019s export of ex-\ncess capacity is leading to increasingly aggressive pushback from\nChina\u2019s major trading partners and the imposition of tariffs by the\nUnited States, the EU, and others.

While the latest stimulus round has the po-\ntential to be among the largest China has passed to deal with the\ncurrent crisis, the measures are insufficient in scale compared to the\nscope of China\u2019s economic challenges, and their long-term impact is\nquestionable.

Although Chinese policymakers have\nrepeatedly stated their intention to increase the contributions of\nservices and consumption to economic growth, in reality, China has\ndoubled down on a variant of its traditional manufacturing and ex-\nport model. China has increased government subsidies and targeted\nsupply-side stimulus toward favored industries, especially those in-\nvolving advanced technology. The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP)\nprioritization of supply-side policies aims to further strengthen Chi-\nna\u2019s manufacturing base and increase its self-sufficiency while si-\nmultaneously increasing Party-state control over domestic capital\nallocation and global supply chains and increasing dependency by\nother nations.

As long as these measures remain a\ncommon practice, Chinese households will remain skeptical of\npassive long-term domestic investment opportunities as a way\nto generate wealth, forcing them to save a larger share of their\nincome.

Chinese\nofficials have built a system predicated on low consumption and\nhigh savings where capital can be funneled by government-con-\ntrolled banks into investments in sectors prioritized by the Party.2\nIn this model, household consumption is at odds with Xi\u2019s goals of\nstrengthening the Party and making China the dominant industrial\nand technological superpower.3 Putting an increased portion of the\nnation\u2019s wealth in the hands of ordinary citizens could decrease the", "nation\u2019s wealth in the hands of ordinary citizens could decrease the\nParty\u2019s control over economic resources, which is core to its ability to\nexert power through its authoritarian hierarchy.* A system based on\ninvestment-led growth reinforces the political status quo by preserv-\ning the Party\u2019s grip on the economy. Overinvestment makes China\u2019s\nindustrial base dependent on cheap financing to survive. Because\nthis financing is overwhelmingly managed by state banks, Chinese\nbusinesses are subservient to Party interests.4\nAn increasingly hostile geopolitical environment, in which other\ncountries have implemented export controls and pursued de-risk-\ning, has also motivated China to double down on this approach.5\nThrough increased investments in manufacturing, Xi hopes to make\nthe Chinese economy more self-sufficient while simultaneously in-\ncreasing the control China exerts over global supply chains.6 Top\nChinese officials believe industrial security sits at the core of Chi-", "Chinese officials believe industrial security sits at the core of Chi-\nna\u2019s stability.7 Though a reorientation toward consumption could\nrevitalize overall GDP growth, Chinese leaders have long believed\na slowdown was inevitable.8 Nonetheless, they appear willing to ac-\ncept slower growth in exchange for increased Party control.9\nTraditional Growth Drivers\nManufacturing\nChinese officials have reemphasized manufacturing as the\ncentral pillar of the country\u2019s economic growth and are at-\ntempting to supplement their dominance of commodified\nmanufactured goods with new, advanced technological prod-\nucts.

As advanced economies implement tariffs, China is shift-\ning exports of manufactured goods to emerging economies, enlarging\nits bilateral trade surpluses across the developing world. Between\n2019 and 2023, China\u2019s manufacturing trade surplus with ASEAN\nmore than doubled, rising from $96 billion to $231 billion.362 Chi-\nnese exports to Latin America and the Caribbean are increasing at\na rapid pace as well.

To combat\npersistent problems of corruption and fears of political disloyalty,\nGeneral Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jin-\nping and a small circle of top leaders tightened their grip on the\nParty rank and file while continuing to unseat and in some cases\ndisappear high-ranking figures across the government and military.\nInternationally, China attempted to promote itself as the world lead-\ner best positioned to solve and prevent conflicts, represent low- and\nmiddle-income countries, and promote economic growth while also\nmaking it clear that it opposed U.S. policies and alliance relation-", "making it clear that it opposed U.S. policies and alliance relation-\nships. In its diplomacy with the United States, China sought to use\nthe promise of bilateral dialogues on narrow areas of common in-\nterest to derail what it perceives as the United States\u2019 policy of\nstrategic competition. It sought to tighten ties with Europe and\nencourage divisions within the transatlantic alliance but continued\nto undermine its own credibility through its intensifying economic,\nmilitary, diplomatic, and political support for Russia. At the same\ntime, China is increasingly providing support and resources to coun-\ntries involved in military operations against Western allies. China\nalso turned a blind eye as Iran and North Korea act in ways that\nundermine global stability, and it has demonstrated willingness to\nexploit tensions in the Middle East for geopolitical gain. Overall,\nChina reacted to other countries\u2019 efforts to protect their economic", "China reacted to other countries\u2019 efforts to protect their economic\nand physical security by portraying them as hostile, exclusionary,\nand destabilizing. In the case of the South China Sea, China re-\nsorted to more dangerous, violent actions. Despite the willingness\nof some governments to deepen cooperation with Beijing in various\ndomains, many other countries remained deeply skeptical of China\u2019s\nintentions and proposals.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 As part of its efforts to solidify its control across the Party, state,\nand military, in 2024 the CCP leadership introduced new mea-\nsures on political discipline and anticorruption, targeting every-\none from low-ranking Party members to senior military officers.\nFrom the top of the system, General Secretary Xi delivered dire\nmessages to Party and military audiences on the severity of\nremaining problems, revived some Maoist concepts and slogans,\nand emphasized the importance of political loyalty and endur-", "and emphasized the importance of political loyalty and endur-\ning hardship. China\u2019s leaders viewed enhanced domestic control\n(92)\n93\nas a key factor in China\u2019s ability to accomplish its domestic and\ninternational objectives.\n\u2022 China continues to assert that the United States poses inten-\nsifying strategic risk. Despite a bilateral agreement reached in\nlate 2023 to pursue limited cooperation on military communi-\ncation, climate change, countering fentanyl and other drugs,\nartificial intelligence (AI), and people-to-people ties, China has\ncontinued its efforts to counter or weaken U.S. policies without\nchanging its own behavior. Fundamental divergences on issues\nsuch as Taiwan and access to markets, capital, and technology\nremain.\n\u2022 In 2024, China accelerated efforts to build international support\nfrom as many countries as possible\u2014with a focus on the devel-\noping nations of what it calls the \u201cGlobal South\u201d\u2014for China\u2019s\nclaims to global leadership, its continuing efforts to isolate and", "claims to global leadership, its continuing efforts to isolate and\nsubjugate Taiwan, and its desired forms of economic coopera-\ntion. At the same time, Beijing sought to portray actions taken\nby the United States and many of its allies and partners to\nprotect their own interests and established global norms as un-\ndermining the prospects for peace, stability, and prosperity and\nthe future of collective international progress led by China. (For\ninformation on China\u2019s activities in the Middle East in 2024,\nsee Chapter 5, \u201cChina and the Middle East.\u201d)\n\u2022 China and Russia committed to further deepening their joint\nefforts against the United States. China has sustained its eco-\nnomic, diplomatic, political, and material support for Russia\u2019s\nwar effort in Ukraine.

The chapter\u2019s findings are based\non open source research and analysis, Commission hearings, and\ndiscussions with outside experts.\nXi Jinping Strengthens Party Control and Oversight\nIn 2024, General Secretary Xi Jinping continued to tighten his\ncontrol over the Party, state, society, and military, broadly framing\nthese efforts as essential to improve China\u2019s ability to accomplish\nits most important domestic and international objectives. Xi em-\nphasized the importance of strengthening political discipline and\nfighting disloyalty while also making use of his signature anticor-\nruption campaign to purge civilian and defense officials alike. He\nalso oversaw further restructuring of the People\u2019s Liberation Army", "also oversaw further restructuring of the People\u2019s Liberation Army\n(PLA) to bring additional domains of warfare under direct control of\nthe political leadership.\nImplications of Xi\u2019s Power for Succession and Stability\nXi\u2019s tight hold on power and apparent disinterest in succession\nplanning creates risk for China\u2019s political system. At the CCP\u2019s\n19th Party Congress in 2017 and again at its 20th in 2022, Xi di-\nverged from what had been previous political practice by not indi-\ncating an intended successor as top leader of the Party.1 Experts\nhave assessed that although Xi\u2019s choices to extend his own rule *\nwithout selecting a successor may increase his own power in the\nshort term, over the long term they increase the risk that the\nregime will experience instability.2 In the continued absence of a\nclear succession plan,\u2020 Xi\u2019s unexpected demise or incapacitation\n* Xi\u2019s positions as CCP general secretary and chairman of the CCP\u2019s Central Military Commis-", "* Xi\u2019s positions as CCP general secretary and chairman of the CCP\u2019s Central Military Commis-\nsion (CMC) do not have term limits. His third top position as the head of state of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC) was previously limited to two terms, but under Xi\u2019s leadership this term\nlimit was removed in 2018, paving the way for him to hold all three positions indefinitely.

If Xi were to pass away, the CCP Charter suggests the CCP Central\nCommittee would meet to select a new general secretary from the current Politburo Standing", "Committee would meet to select a new general secretary from the current Politburo Standing\nCommittee and to select a new CMC chairman, although these two leaders need not necessarily\nbe the same person. According to the PRC Constitution, the role of head of state would pass to\nthe sitting vice president of China\u2014who currently is not a member of the Politburo Standing\nCommittee and thus not a candidate for the other two top positions. Informal consultation and\nbargaining by Party elites would likely play an important role in determining who is ultimately\nselected, a process that could be particularly fraught or prone to infighting in the event of a\nsudden power vacuum.

At the 2021 summit, Xi had vowed to import\n$300 billion worth of African goods over three years.367 China failed\nto reach this target, and in his address to the 2024 summit, Xi made\n138\nonly vague promises to \u201cunilaterally expand\u201d access to the Chinese\nmarket.368\nChina Elevates Diplomatic Outreach to Countries in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean", "market.368\nChina Elevates Diplomatic Outreach to Countries in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean\nChina sought to deepen its diplomatic and political engagement\nwith countries in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2024 as part\nof its effort to cast itself as a leader of what it refers to as the\n\u201cGlobal South.\u201d Most notably and for the first time, after its regular\ncommencement in Africa, Foreign Minister Wang\u2019s first overseas trip\nof the year also included visits to two countries in Latin America\nand the Caribbean,* namely Brazil and Jamaica.\u2020 369 In meetings\nthroughout the year, China\u2019s diplomats tried to present China as a\nkey partner for economic development opportunities and a partner\nwho would work with Latin American and Caribbean countries to\nsafeguard their interests internationally.370 Chinese officials also\nconducted party-to-party exchanges in Mexico (multiparty par-\nliamentary delegation), El Salvador (New Ideas Party), and Cuba", "liamentary delegation), El Salvador (New Ideas Party), and Cuba\n(Communist Party of Cuba) seeking to promote China\u2019s internation-\nal interests.371\nChina sought to deepen political exchanges with Brazil and fur-\nther efforts to counterbalance the United States and its allies, with\nsome success.

Innovation in emerging technologies could transform society,\ncreate new industries, foster new dependencies, and alter the char-\nacter of warfare. Whichever country secures a lead in key technol-\nogies\u2014particularly those with first mover advantages\u2014will tip the\nbalance of power in its favor and reap economic benefits far into the\n21st century. China under General Secretary of the Chinese Commu-\nnist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping has recognized the potential advantages\nof seizing the innovation \u201chigh ground\u201d in this competition and has\naggressively designed, implemented, and funded programs to domi-\nnate technologies of the future.

While QIS is still in an ear-\nly stage of development, it will have significant competitive and\nmilitary impacts if it becomes commercially viable. China\u2019s Par-\n171\nty-state drives quantum research through support to a major\nstate laboratory in Anhui Province as well as a growing roster\nof state-backed startup companies.

For years, Chinese companies and\nthe Party-state have sought to acquire U.S. cutting-edge technolo-\ngy, intellectual property (IP), and know-how through licit and illicit\nmeans. For much of that time, outside of narrow export controls and\noccasional foreign investment reviews, U.S. policy was inadequate-", "occasional foreign investment reviews, U.S. policy was inadequate-\nly responsive to China\u2019s technology policies and ambitions. A large\n174\nconstraint on technology transfer to China in many areas came from\nthe reluctance of U.S. companies to transfer their best technology to\nChina out of concerns over IP theft rather than U.S. law.2 In recent\nyears, however, successive administrations and Congress have iden-\ntified emerging technologies as central to the U.S.-China strategic\ncompetition.\nAs attitudes in the United States have shifted, the United States\nhas taken a number of steps in recent years to better protect U.S.\nnational security and shore up U.S. advantages in the development,\nproduction, and protection of these technologies. U.S. policymakers\nhave identified certain \u201ccritical and emerging technologies\u201d or \u201cfoun-\ndational\u201d technologies as vital to economic and national security,\nincluding advanced semiconductors, quantum information systems,", "including advanced semiconductors, quantum information systems,\nand AI; biotechnologies and biomanufacturing; and clean energy\ngeneration and storage technology.3 Each of these families of tech-\nnologies carries the potential to be a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d across the\nvarious fields of technology, accelerating the broader pace of innova-\ntion and adoption, and serving as a bedrock upon which to ground\nfuture industries.4 Each also has significant national security im-\nplications.\nU.S. policy has begun to shift to recognize the importance of com-\npetition with China over these critical technologies. In recent years,\nthe United States has made investments to help ensure it retains\nan edge in key foundational technologies; it has also expanded use\nof export controls relating to advanced semiconductors and AI and\ntightened up other avenues that adversaries use to gain access to\nsensitive U.S. technology.

In con-\ntrast to the more market-oriented innovation landscape in the Unit-\ned States, the state takes on a much more prominent role in China\u2019s\ntechnology ecosystem, with the government strategically allocating\nfunding and resources to industries and research areas deemed a\npriority.5 The results of abundant and sustained state support have\nbeen mixed, creating expected inefficiencies commonly associated\nwith centrally planned economies and yet also enabling tremendous\nreturns to scale for fledgling industries that have resulted in clear\ncomparative advantages for Chinese producers of certain technolo-\n175\ngies.6 Despite the traction of some of these efforts, China faces chal-\nlenges, including a shortage of highly skilled workers and economic\nheadwinds.7 Additionally, while China has increased its scientific\nresearch and patent output, translating these findings into ground-", "research and patent output, translating these findings into ground-\nbreaking innovations and economic benefits remains a hurdle.8\nChina under the CCP has a long history of techno-nationalism, of-\nten rooted in fear of being dominated by technologically superior for-\neign powers.9 For example, China successfully developed the atomic\nbomb in 1964 through \u201cProject 596,\u201d a national initiative that aimed\nto build nuclear weapons.10 Similar national innovation programs\nhave been used to achieve advancement in targeted technology ar-\neas, such as the National High-Tech R&D Program (863 Program)\nestablished in 1986 and the National Basic Research Program (973\nProgram) established in 1997.11 These large government-funded\ninitiatives channeled financing and resources to scientists and en-\ntrepreneurs credited with producing the world\u2019s first quantum tele-\nphone network, improved solar technology, and the Tianhe-1A su-\npercomputer, which for a time was the world\u2019s fastest computer.12", "percomputer, which for a time was the world\u2019s fastest computer.12\nIn the mid-2000s, China made explicit its intention to use technol-\nogy policy to move up the value chain of global production, increase\nits indigenous capacity, and become a global leader in certain tech-\nnology areas. The 2006 Medium- to Long-Term Program (MLP) for\nthe Development of Science and Technology articulated the need to\nfacilitate indigenous innovation and set specific goals to be achieved\nby 2020. These included targets in research and development (R&D)\nspending, patent filing, and publication of academic articles.13 Chi-\nna implemented numerous policies under the MLP in the ensuing\nyears, many of which ran counter to the letter and spirit of WTO\nrules.14\nTechno-Nationalism Accelerates under Xi\nGeneral Secretary Xi has continued\u2014and in recent years, accel-\nerated\u2014these techno-nationalist policies, focusing efforts on tech-\nnologies he believes are transformative and can propel China into", "nologies he believes are transformative and can propel China into\ndominance this century by leapfrogging the United States.

For example, Ford announced\nin February 2023 that it would start producing low-cost lithium-ion\nbatteries by 2026 at its plant in Michigan using technology licensed\nfrom CATL.606 This illustrates one of the main challenges for U.S.\nindustries seeking to reduce reliance on Chinese batteries. Even if\nthe United States reduces dependencies on physical Chinese bat-\nteries, China continues to dominate battery supply chains and even\nresearch in battery technology, publishing about half of the world\u2019s\nresearch on battery efficiency.607 As a result, Chinese firms often\nmaintain an edge over U.S. competitors in technology, IP, and know-\nhow in battery manufacturing.608 Ford is therefore in an unenviable", "how in battery manufacturing.608 Ford is therefore in an unenviable\nposition of licensing state-of-the art CATL technology and IP, even\nas the Administration seeks to limit the reach of Chinese battery\nmakers in the United States.609 The planned partnership appears\nset to proceed amid bipartisan congressional concerns and the Ad-\nministration\u2019s new rules, which do not directly prohibit the Ford-\nCATL agreement.610\nInternet of Things (IoT) Raises Growing Concern\nThere is rising concern of potential security threats to U.S. net-\nworks associated with Chinese-made devices.611 In recent years,\nthe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has placed ten\nChinese companies\u2014including Huawei, ZTE, and Hangzhou\nHikvision Digital Technology\u2014on its Covered List that prevents\nthe marketing, sale, or operation of any equipment within the\nUnited States due to national security risks.612 Recent attention\nhas focused on cellular modules produced by Chinese companies,", "has focused on cellular modules produced by Chinese companies,\nwhich connect IoT \u2020 devices to the internet that have the poten-\ntial to be remotely accessed and controlled from China.613 Chi-\n* Under the rules set to be implemented over 2024, companies will be denied tax credits if ve-\nhicle batteries contain components that were manufactured or assembled by an FEOC. Beginning\nin 2025, the rules expand in scope to disqualify any vehicles whose batteries contain any critical\nminerals extracted, processed, or recycled by an FEOC.

Similar to the concerns raised by Mr.\nSingleton, independent cybersecurity researchers have demonstrat-\ned the ability of Chinese-made EVs and EV charging equipment\nto collect and transmit data back to China and install malware.617\nIn February 2024, the Commerce Department issued an Advanced\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking to address threats stemming from\n\u201cconnected vehicles\u201d from China.618 On September 23, 2024, BIS\nreleased a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to address security con-\ncerns from connected vehicles that, if finalized, will prohibit the", "cerns from connected vehicles that, if finalized, will prohibit the\nsale or import of certain types of Chinese hardware and software\nintegrated into vehicle connectivity systems and automated driving\nsystems to take effect for model years 2027 and 2030, dependent on\nthe type of technology.619\nImplications for the United States\nU.S.-China technology competition is foundational to both U.S.-Chi-\nna economic competition and national security. China has realized\nthe importance of technology supremacy for decades and consistent-\nly implemented policies designed to gain an edge in technologies of\nthe future. If China surpasses the United States in the development\nand deployment of these technologies at scale, industries critical for\nthe United States and its allies could become overly reliant on Chi-\nna, and the balance of regional and global power could shift in the\nPLA\u2019s favor.

The United States has already begun to take aggressive\nsteps to ensure continued U.S. technological leadership in these sec-\ntors through domestic investments, export controls, and investment\nrestrictions, and it is considering other policies, but some hurdles\nremain.\nAdvanced computing technology, including AI, is at the forefront\nof U.S.-China technology competition. AI will add tremendous value\nto the global economy and reshape a swath of industries. AI also has\n* Quectel refuted concerns raised regarding the security of its modules. In a press release,\nQuectel Wireless Solutions stated that \u201cQuectel customers own the data, and [Quectel has] no\naccess to any of the data collected.\u201d Business Wire, \u201cQuectel Response to FCC about IoT Module\nSecurity,\u201d September 7, 2023; David Shepardson, \u201cUS FCC Chair Says China\u2019s Quectel, Fibocom\nMay Pose National Security Risks,\u201d Reuters, September 6, 2023.\n234\nthe potential to transform the military balance between the Unit-", "234\nthe potential to transform the military balance between the Unit-\ned States and China by helping both militaries improve their data\nanalysis, accelerate battlefield decision-making, and more effective-\nly target the adversary.620 One key to AI competition is advanced\nsemiconductors, where the United States has a lead but China is\ninvesting heavily to catch up. Separately, there is a risk that China\nmay flood the world with cheap legacy semiconductors, forcing pric-\nes down, which may threaten the viability of other countries\u2019 legacy\nsemiconductor industries and provide China with significant global\neconomic leverage. Another aspect of competition in AI is the quality\nand performance of AI models. Amid a vigorous debate within the\nAI industry over whether open source or closed source models are\nthe better approach, entities in China have been using U.S. open\nsource models as the basis for some of their technological advances.", "source models as the basis for some of their technological advances.\nThere is not currently a U.S. policy framework that focuses on the\ndifferences between the two approaches for U.S.-China technology\ncompetition. Moreover, experts have also expressed concern over the\nneed to address cloud computing, a key potential workaround that\ncould allow Chinese firms or even the PLA itself to access highly\nadvanced AI and quantum computing capabilities located in dif-\nferent countries and delivered remotely via the cloud.621 While ex-\nisting controls on AI have limited such access to a certain extent,\ntechnological change, developments in global markets, and evolving\nChinese policy responses all underscore the importance of regularly\nreviewing U.S. export controls and related policies.\nWhile practical breakthroughs from QIS are generally yet to be\nrealized, the potentially profound economic and national security\nimplications of such technologies require close scrutiny. The country", "implications of such technologies require close scrutiny. The country\nthat has the edge in quantum technologies will be able to protect\nits communications networks from eavesdropping and interception,\nbreak adversaries\u2019 encryption methods, bolster its scientific research,\nand deploy advanced sensing capabilities to detect enemy military\nassets.622 To date, the U.S. export control policy response for QIS\nhas been limited, at least in part because defense applications have\nbeen viewed as less achievable within the short to medium term\nfor most aspects of QIS other than quantum sensing.623 Unlike the\nadvanced semiconductor controls used for AI, U.S. quantum tech-\nnology controls primarily only target specific Chinese end users in-\nstead of the other enabling technology categories. Questions remain\nregarding the effectiveness of the end user approach, the utility of\nbroader controls on enabling technologies and access to R&D and", "broader controls on enabling technologies and access to R&D and\nknow-how, and potential opportunities for multilateral cooperation\nwith allies.624\nU.S.-China competition in biotechnology will have significant eco-\nnomic impacts in terms of capabilities in numerous technologies and\nmanufacturing industries of the future, and for some applications\nit will have direct national security implications. In addition, ge-\nnomic-related biotechnologies raise concerns about data collection,\nincluding access to sensitive health and genetic data on U.S. citizens\nand abuse for surveillance purposes. At the same time, many appli-\ncations of biotechnology would provide overall benefits to health-\ncare, medicine, and related technologies, and traditionally, coopera-\ntive scientific research in such fields has been supported. While the\n235\nUnited States leads in many areas of innovation in biotechnology,\nChinese biotechnology companies such as BGI and WuXi have be-", "Chinese biotechnology companies such as BGI and WuXi have be-\ncome integral in U.S. genomic and pharmaceutical supply chains,\nraising concerns over dependency for medical and agricultural prod-\nucts. Furthermore, these companies are obtaining advantages over\ntime due to their access to sensitive data and proprietary commer-\ncial information, an area of particular concern given their alleged\nties to the PLA.\nFinally, the rapid expansion and dominant position China has\nattained in the global battery industry presents an expansive\nchallenge for policymakers in an emerging technology with major\nimplications for the transition to clean and renewable energy sys-\ntems. With China\u2019s overwhelming presence throughout the battery\nproduction supply chain, Chinese companies are poised to maintain\nsubstantial advantages and market share for powering clean energy\ntechnologies that rely on batteries, likely requiring U.S. manufactur-", "technologies that rely on batteries, likely requiring U.S. manufactur-\ners to rely on suppliers and IP from China at least for the short and\nmedium term.625 Moreover, the proliferation of Chinese batteries\nwithin U.S. networks, including vital energy infrastructures, creates\ncyber security-related concerns, vulnerabilities to remote manipu-\nlation, and sabotage. Experts indicate that Chinese-made batteries\nheighten the risk of espionage or unforeseen energy supply disrup-\ntions and system failures as they become further integrated into\ncritical U.S. operations.626 Recent U.S. policies have taken limited\nsteps to address these challenges, specifically provisions in the Infla-\ntion Reduction Act incentivizing domestic production of clean energy\nvehicles and the recent Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to\nstudy risks from connected vehicles and associated systems.\n236\nENDNOTES FOR CHAPTER 3\n1.

These new channels,\ncombined with China\u2019s reinvigorated focus on export manufactur-\ning as a pillar of economic growth, mean that Chinese factories\nwill remain major suppliers across the consumer products space.\nThough the quality of goods sourced from China has improved\nsomewhat over the past two decades as a result of increased due", "somewhat over the past two decades as a result of increased due\ndiligence and monitoring on the factory floor, significant excep-\ntions remain, and overall product quality and safety still fall short\nof U.S. standards. Many Chinese companies that disregard manu-\nfacturing best practices utilize cross-border e-commerce channels\nto send products directly to consumers under a de minimis ex-\nemption that provides duty-free entry for small parcel shipments.\nA continually rising flood of small parcels at U.S. ports of entry\ncompounds the difficulty of detecting potentially risky products\nbefore they reach households and children. Holding Chinese man-\nufacturers and exporters accountable remains challenging\u2014if not\nvirtually impossible\u2014under the Xi regime. Moreover, China is\nhome to the world\u2019s largest counterfeiting industry, harming not\nonly U.S. businesses but also consumers who face increased safe-\nty risks from shoddily made imitations. Accurate data on consum-", "ty risks from shoddily made imitations. Accurate data on consum-\ner product imports are crucial to enforcement, but an increased\nnumber of Chinese exporters are seeking to exploit loopholes in\nU.S. law and disguise the nature and/or origins of their imports\nto dodge higher tariffs on products from China.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 China aims to continue growing its manufacturing sector,\nleading to further industrial overcapacity and a surge in ex-\nports. Chinese manufacturers have, in general, improved in\nquality and reliability over the past decade, owing in part\nto increased enforcement by Chinese authorities domesti-\ncally and increased due diligence by foreign firms. Howev-\ner, the scale and dynamism of China\u2019s manufacturing sector\nmeans regulators in the United States struggle to respond\nto emergent product safety issues. New online platforms and\nthe multitude of third-party e-commerce sellers and resellers\ncompound these issues.\n(271)\n272", "the multitude of third-party e-commerce sellers and resellers\ncompound these issues.\n(271)\n272\n\u2022 U.S. regulators are overwhelmed by the volume of imports ar-\nriving from China, and they are only able to inspect a small\nfraction of imports, potentially leaving large numbers of unsafe\nor illegal goods to enter the U.S. market daily.\n\u2022 Unscrupulous China-based sellers lack the diligence, capacity,\nand skill required to produce high-quality goods that meet U.S.\nsafety regulations, thus increasing U.S. consumers\u2019 exposure to\nrisks stemming from unsafe, counterfeit, and poor-quality goods\nfrom China. These deceptive tactics by Chinese producers are\nparticularly concerning in industries such as batteries and med-\nical products, where defective products pose potentially debili-\ntating or deadly consequences.\n\u2022 U.S. import regulators face significant challenges in monitoring\nthe growing volume of Chinese e-commerce shipments specifi-", "the growing volume of Chinese e-commerce shipments specifi-\ncally, which typically enter under a de minimis exemption that\nprovides duty-free treatment for parcels valued under $800.\nThe growth of smaller, China-based sellers on U.S. e-commerce\nsites and the rising popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms\npresent a novel and growing risk to U.S. consumers and the\nability to enforce safety regulations and other laws. Insufficient\ndata, personnel, and overwhelming volume mean these ship-\nments receive less scrutiny.\n\u2022 Some Chinese companies have tried to circumvent normal U.S.\ncustoms channels in response to tariffs and other U.S. laws.\nThough the true scale of customs fraud is unknowable, some ac-\ntors are using illegal tactics such as transshipment, circumven-\ntion, and import undervaluation to evade paying customs duties.\nThese tactics worsen the information available to U.S. agencies,\nincreasing the challenge of identifying hazardous imports.\nRecommendations", "increasing the challenge of identifying hazardous imports.\nRecommendations\nThe Commission recommends:\n\u2022 With respect to imports sold through an online marketplace,\nCongress eliminate Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (also\nknown as the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption), which allows goods val-\nued under $800 to enter the United States duty free and, for\nall practical purposes, with less rigorous regulatory inspection.\nCongress should provide U.S. Customs and Border Protection\nadequate resources, including staff and technology, for imple-\nmentation, monitoring, and enforcement.\n\u2022 Congress amend the Consumer Product Safety Act to (1) grant\nthe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) unilat-\neral mandatory recall authority over products where the Chi-\nnese seller is unresponsive to requests from the CPSC for fur-\nther information or to initiate a voluntary recall and the CPSC\nhas evidence of a substantial product hazard, defined as either", "has evidence of a substantial product hazard, defined as either\nfailing to comply with any CPSC rule, regulation, standard, or\nban or posing a substantial risk of injury to the public; and (2)\nclassify Chinese e-commerce platforms as distributors to allow\nfor enforcement of recalls and other safety standards for prod-\nucts sold on these platforms.\n273\n\u2022 Congress direct the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\nand U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in conjunction with\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce, to develop assessment\ntools capable of identifying the true origins of parts, com-\nponents, and materials contained in products entering the\nUnited States to prevent tariff evasion and limit safety and\nsecurity risks in light of the increasing complexity of global\nsupply chains.\n\u2022 Congress require that the U.S. Trade Representative, in consul-\ntation with the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Inter-\nnational Trade Commission, and other entities, as appropriate,", "national Trade Commission, and other entities, as appropriate,\nprepare a comprehensive report within 90 days on the operation\nof the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement since its entry into\nforce that provides data and information on:\n\u25cb Chinese-affiliated investments in Mexico and Canada and spe-\ncific information on their production of goods and how those\ngoods may enter the U.S. market either as finished products\nor as components in other products;\n\u25cb Trade flows of products produced in China to Mexico and\nCanada and how such trade flows have changed;\n\u25cb Prices of products produced in China shipped to Mexico and\nCanada as well as products shipped through those countries\nto the United States and how those prices relate to the prices\nof such goods shipped directly into the U.S. market; and\n\u25cb Trade enforcement actions by Mexico and Canada regard-\ning Chinese-produced products (including those transshipped\nthrough third countries\u2019 markets) and how such actions relate", "through third countries\u2019 markets) and how such actions relate\nto U.S. trade enforcement actions.\n\u2022 Congress amend applicable laws to mandate that online mar-\nketplaces clearly disclose on product listings for Chinese-made\ngoods the name, physical address, and contact information for\nthe manufacturer. The online marketplaces should also be re-\nquired to clearly display a warning label that the item is man-\nufactured in a country that does not comply with U.S. consumer\nsafety standards.\n\u2022 Congress direct the U.S. Government Accountability Office to\ninvestigate the reliability of safety testing certifications for con-\nsumer products and medical devices imported from China.\nIntroduction\nAccording to data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Unit-\ned States imported $426.9 billion in goods from China in 2023, al-\nthough this undercounts e-commerce sales.1 Everything from water\nheaters to consumer electronic products to pool drain covers and", "heaters to consumer electronic products to pool drain covers and\nchildren\u2019s toys are made in factories across China and then shipped\ninto the U.S. market. In most cases, these Chinese-made products\npresent minimal to no health and safety risks to U.S. consumers,\nin part due to efforts by U.S.-based importers and retailers to vet\nand monitor the quality of manufacturing taking place in China.\nHowever, changing consumption patterns and marketing and sell-\n274\ning strategies by Chinese firms are increasingly exposing U.S. con-\nsumers to poorly made and poorly regulated goods from China. A\nlarge and increasing portion of imports from China comes from on-\nline shopping\u2014and specifically by the purchase of consumer goods\nthrough e-commerce platforms with direct delivery to homes. These\nplatforms directly connect U.S. consumers to China-based manufac-\nturers that often lack the diligence, capacity, and skill required to\nproduce high-quality goods that meet U.S. safety regulations. More-", "produce high-quality goods that meet U.S. safety regulations. More-\nover, since these firms are based in China, they generally lie outside\nthe reach of U.S. regulators, courts, and law enforcement agencies.\nThey are therefore able to sell unsafe goods directly into the U.S.\nmarket and are unlikely to ever be held accountable for the harm\nthese products cause. These problems are further compounded by\nthe limited capacity to monitor the millions of small parcels that\nenter the U.S. market duty free each day under a de minimis exemp-\ntion.* As a result, billions of dollars of potentially unsafe, hazardous,\nand even deadly goods are shipped from China directly to the door-\nsteps of U.S. homes every year, presenting a risk to U.S. consumers\nand firms alike.\nU.S. information on imports from China is hampered by illegal\nand duplicitous behavior by some Chinese exporters. Billions of dol-\nlars\u2019 worth of counterfeit goods from China are seized each year by", "lars\u2019 worth of counterfeit goods from China are seized each year by\nU.S. customs authorities, although this is likely just a fraction of the\nknockoff goods sold into the U.S. market. In addition to infringing\non intellectual property rights (IPR) and causing financial and repu-\ntational harm to U.S. businesses, Chinese counterfeits may lack the\nsafety features and materials of legitimate products, posing hazards\nto U.S. consumers from toxic materials and other risks. Parallel to\nthis behavior, an increased number of exporters are seeking to avoid\nor evade U.S. customs duties. Recent U.S. trade actions taken since\n2018 resulted in increased tariffs on two-thirds of goods entering\nthe U.S. market from China, creating an increased financial incen-\ntive to game the U.S. import process and mitigate tariff burdens.\nThough the true scale of illegal behavior is unknowable, anecdotal\nevidence suggests a rising number of companies are employing tac-", "evidence suggests a rising number of companies are employing tac-\ntics like transshipment, circumvention, and evasion to avoid tariffs,\namplifying the challenges facing U.S. customs officials.\nThis chapter begins with an overview of the challenges in assur-\ning the quality of China-based producers, which are amplified by the\nscale of China\u2019s manufacturing sector as well as challenges in en-\nsuring the quality of goods from China-based producers.

This issue is especially acute in the\nconsumer products sector, which constitutes roughly half of China\u2019s\nexports to the United States.2 China is the largest source of con-\nsumer goods for the United States, accounting for over 25 percent\nof U.S. consumer product imports in 2023.3 This total, amounting to", "of U.S. consumer product imports in 2023.3 This total, amounting to\n$210.2 billion, exceeded the combined value of consumer products\nsourced from the United States\u2019 next four largest trading partners.4\nChinese producers likely have an even larger role in the consumer\nproducts space than these data indicate, as they undercount e-com-\nmerce shipments and also do not reflect China\u2019s expanding role as\na supplier of manufacturing inputs. China\u2019s export manufacturing\ncapacity will likely expand further as China\u2019s government focuses\non export manufacturing as a pillar of economic growth amid the\neconomy\u2019s slowdown. (For more, see Chapter 1, \u201cU.S.-China Econom-\nic and Trade Relations (Year in Review).\u201d) As a consequence, the\nmanufacturing practices and standards of Chinese manufacturers\nwill continue to have an outsized impact on the safety and quality\nof goods for sale in the U.S. market.\nIn addition to this overwhelming volume of goods, U.S. regulators", "In addition to this overwhelming volume of goods, U.S. regulators\nare also sifting through a growing number of factories in China that\nare sending goods into the U.S. market.

As U.S. imports shifted to third countries, some Chinese\nexporters sought to lower their tariff burden by transiting goods\nthrough these new export hubs. In 2019, Vietnam\u2019s customs agency\nidentified dozens of products destined for the United States that", "identified dozens of products destined for the United States that\nwere imported from China and given \u201cmade in Vietnam\u201d labels.93\nClosely related to transshipment is duty circumvention, which in-\nvolves importing products subject to an AD/CVD order or compo-\nnents of those products into a third country, doing minimal addition-\nal processing (e.g., assembling components), and exporting the final\nproduct as originating in the country of minimal processing.* 94 It\nis challenging, however, to quantify the full extent of transshipment\nand circumvention (see textbox below). Between FY 2017 and FY\n2023, CBP completed more than 200 investigations into AD/CVD\nevasion under the EAPA and identified $1.2 billion in duties owed\nto the U.S. government.95\nEvaluating Transshipment and Circumvention Based on\nTrade Data\nAs documented by a number of scholars, third countries that\nincreased their exports to the United States since 2017 fre-\nquently increased imports from China of the exact same product", "quently increased imports from China of the exact same product\ncodes they were shipping to the United States, suggesting that\nfinished goods were merely being rerouted through other econo-\nmies.96 However, the correlation between third countries\u2019 imports\nfrom China and exports to the United States may also reflect\nlegitimate trade. Rules of origin can be complicated and very\nproduct-specific. Even when a product imported from China is\nexported without a change in its tariff classification, a domestic\nmanufacturer can significantly transform the good in a way that\nmeets U.S. criteria for country of origin. Further, the apparent\nflow of Chinese products through these markets may instead re-\nflect imports for final demand by these countries.

For instance, after the United States placed an AD/CVD\non Chinese solar panels in the early 2010s, Chinese solar com-\npanies sought out other markets for their subsidized production,\ncausing shipments of solar products that were previously bound\nfor the United States to shift to countries such as Malaysia.97\nMany of these Chinese imports were used for solar installation\n* AD/CVD circumvention as defined in the Tariff Act of 1930 also covers making minor alter-\nations in the original country so that the product falls outside the coverage of the AD/CVD order\nwhile still retaining the same general characteristics.

For instance, the lack of HTS data inhibits CPSC from\nscreening for products subject to high standards, like children\u2019s\nproducts, and inadequate data on the manufacturer prevents\ntargeting imports based on risk factors such as past violations.\nAs Mr. Joholske testified, \u201cWithout the same data as we have on\nhigher value shipments, CPSC cannot utilize its risk assessment\nmethodology to know what should be targeted for inspection.\u201d 217\nThese issues pose challenges to the enforcement of other laws,\nincluding the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.218\nTo mitigate these issues, CBP has initiated data pilots to be-\ngin collecting additional information on de minimis imports, but", "gin collecting additional information on de minimis imports, but\nparticipation in these programs remains voluntary.

In practice, many importers and manufacturers email\nthe certificate to CPSC when requested. A new proposal by CPSC would change this process to\na mandatory e-filing system for foreign manufacturers when the product is imported. In a past\nstudy, CPSC found that shipments accompanied by a certificate, or where a certificate was pro-\nvided within 24 hours of request, are significantly less likely to violate safety rules than products\nfor which it took longer than 24 hours to provide the certificate or where no certificate was ever", "for which it took longer than 24 hours to provide the certificate or where no certificate was ever\nprovided, even after CSPC requested one. No shipments, including de minimis, would be exempt\nfrom the e-filing requirement.

Moreover, since these manufacturers lie out-\nside the jurisdiction of U.S. regulators, courts, and law enforcement,\nthese firms are not held accountable for the unsafe and sometimes\ndeadly goods they sell. This combination of unfettered access and\nlimited consequences allows China-based sellers to disregard critical\nU.S. safety regulations.

As China has deepened its trade and investment\ninterests in the Middle East over the past decade, it has also built\na variety of diplomatic partnerships and sought to present itself as\na neutral arbiter of regional disputes while expanding its military\nactivity in the region. Chinese engagement with the Middle East\nis selective and transactional, focused on advancing its own inter-\nests; Beijing appears to have little desire to play a significant role\nin advancing regional security or to meaningfully contribute to a\nresolution of ongoing disputes, including the recent Israel-Hamas", "resolution of ongoing disputes, including the recent Israel-Hamas\nwar. Instead, China appears content for the moment to free-ride on\nthe U.S. and allied regional security infrastructure\u2014including, most\nrecently, the defense of maritime shipping from Houthi attacks\u2014\nwhile blaming the United States for promoting instability. China\nalso works to undermine U.S. ties with key Middle Eastern partners\nwhile supporting adversarial countries like Iran. Chinese strategists\nlikely also assess that the turmoil in the Middle East deflects a por-\ntion of U.S. attention and resources away from the Indo-Pacific. In\nthe short run, China benefits from its relationships in the Middle\nEast focused on energy trade and securing infrastructure contracts\nfor its state-owned enterprises. In the long term, Beijing aims to\nexpand market share for renewable energy and high-value exports,\ngain supporters in its bid for global leadership, and potentially es-", "gain supporters in its bid for global leadership, and potentially es-\ntablish new outposts capable of supporting its military for increased\npower projection. China\u2019s involvement in the Middle East thus pres-\nents U.S. policymakers with an array of economic, normative, and\ngeopolitical challenges.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 China\u2019s engagement with the Middle East has expanded during\nthe tenure of General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Par-\nty (CCP) Xi Jinping and is driven partly by deepening strategic\nrivalry with the United States. In contrast to the Indo-Pacific,\nwhere China clearly seeks to displace the United States and\nconsolidate a position as the dominant power, the Middle East\nis a region Chinese leaders view as a source of intractable se-\ncurity challenges and value primarily for its resources and eco-\n(333)\n334\nnomic potential. While China does not have the willingness and\nability to replace the United States as a major contributor to", "ability to replace the United States as a major contributor to\nregional security, it is nonetheless eager to instrumentalize the\nregion in its efforts to construct a new, illiberal world order at\nthe United States\u2019 expense. China offers the region\u2019s autocratic\ngovernments a vision of a new regional security architecture\nunder the Global Security Initiative and is deepening its dip-\nlomatic relations with U.S. partners and adversaries alike to\nerode Washington\u2019s influence.\n\u2022 Beijing\u2019s reaction to the Israel-Hamas war has illustrated both\nthe limits of its diplomatic influence in the Middle East and\nits willingness to exploit regional tensions for geopolitical gain.\nChina has played no significant role in the U.S.- and Arab-facil-\nitated negotiations between Israel and Hamas, having lost its\ncredibility as a neutral actor by refusing to directly condemn\nthe terrorist group for the October 7th attacks. It has not con-\ntributed to coalition efforts to protect maritime shipping from", "tributed to coalition efforts to protect maritime shipping from\nHouthi attacks, and in contravention of international maritime\nlaw and norms it has declined to use its naval ships deployed\nin the region to respond to distress signals from non-Chinese\nvessels. Rather, Beijing has sought to appeal to Arab states and\nburnish its image as the self-declared leader of what it calls the\n\u201cGlobal South\u201d by portraying itself as an ardent supporter of\nPalestinian national liberation and condemning Israel and the\nUnited States as oppressors.\n\u2022 China is the largest trading partner for many countries in the\nregion, with growth in total trade and direct investment be-\ntween China and the Middle East outpacing that of China with\nthe rest of the world over the past five years. While China ben-\nefits from infrastructure contracts and expanding market share\nfor its exports to the region, its principle economic objective re-\nmains securing steady flows of energy resources, with between", "mains securing steady flows of energy resources, with between\n40 and 50 percent of China\u2019s total imported energy coming from\nthe region.\n\u2022 China and Iran have a similar interest in opposing the U.S.-\nled rules-based international order, but the relationship is to\na large degree one of convenience. Just as it is using Russia\u2019s\ndiplomatic isolation to extract favorable terms on energy deals,\nChina is opportunistically leveraging its consumption market to\npurchase discounted oil from Iran while going to great lengths\nto avoid the appearance of sanctionable transactions through\nthe use of smaller purchases and shell companies.\n\u2022 China\u2019s military activities in the Middle East advance its eco-\nnomic interests while allowing the People\u2019s Liberation Army\n(PLA) to gain operational experience and lay the foundation for\na more robust future military presence.\n\u2022 China is emerging as a global competitor in niche sectors of the\nMiddle Eastern arms market.

China continues to either directly\nor indirectly provide regional actors with technologies that con-\ntravene its voluntary but non-binding commitment to adhere to\nthe Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).

In terms of economic goals, China seeks access to resources\nand markets across the region, buying energy, increasing trade, and\nwinning infrastructure construction contracts.18 According to writ-\nten testimony before the Commission by Dawn C.

According to a 2020 article\nby Chinese scholar Tong Fei, an associate researcher at the Chi-\nnese Academy of Social Sciences\u2019 Institute of West-Asian and Afri-\ncan Studies, as the United States has shifted its focus to Asia, Arab\ncountries\u2014including the UAE\u2014have pursued alternative partners,\nparticularly in the economic realm.127 The UAE is home to an es-\ntimated quarter million Chinese nationals, and Chinese firms are\nactive there in construction and other fields.128 Dr. Tong asserts that\n\u201csince adopting an eastward foreign policy, the UAE has made deep-", "\u201csince adopting an eastward foreign policy, the UAE has made deep-\nening its comprehensive strategic partnership with China a top pri-\nority in its diplomatic goals.\u201d 129 In his testimony to the Commission,\nDr. Alterman noted that \u201cthe Abu Dhabi government increasingly\nhas sought to strike an \u2018active neutrality\u2019 posture in the world,\u201d\ngrowing its ties with both China and Russia and confident that it is\npowerful enough to advance its own interests.130\nDespite the UAE\u2019s willingness to work with Beijing, Chinese ex-\nperts still assess that there are challenges in their diplomatic re-\nlations that need to be overcome. Dr. Tong assesses that although\nthe UAE hopes to take advantage of BRI, strengthen investment\ncooperation with China, get rid of excessive dependence on oil, and\naccelerate its economic diversification process, the two countries\nhave little understanding of each other due to regional differences\nand separate ideologies.131 Dr. Tong argues that government offi-", "and separate ideologies.131 Dr. Tong argues that government offi-\ncials and ordinary people in the UAE not only lack a deep under-\nstanding of China but also have doubts about Beijing\u2019s Middle East\npolicy.132 Furthermore, Dr. Tong states that \u201csome UAE elites hope\nthat China can assume more peace and security responsibilities in\nthe Middle East and become a force that can compete with the Unit-\ned States in the Middle East\u201d but that the UAE has concerns about\nChina\u2019s cooperation with Iran, which it views as a threat.133 Dr.\nTong also asserts that some within the UAE are dissatisfied with\nthe trade deficit with China, as China has used BRI to obtain en-\nergy from the UAE but is unwilling to buy petrochemical products\nthe UAE wants to sell to China.134 Dr. Tong assesses that because\nof this, \u201cit can be said that the mutual political trust in the coopera-\n350\ntion between the two sides is still relatively fragile.\u201d 135 (For more on", "350\ntion between the two sides is still relatively fragile.\u201d 135 (For more on\nthe challenges that China and the UAE\u2019s technological cooperation\nface under increasing U.S. scrutiny, see the section on \u201cChina-Middle\nEast Technology Relations\u201d within this chapter.)\nThe Reach of Chinese Media in the Middle East\nOver the past decade, China has dramatically increased its ef-\nforts to build what it calls \u201cdiscourse power\u201d\u2014the ability to shape\nglobal public opinion in the way it does domestically\u2014through its\nmedia presence in Middle Eastern countries.136 It has been pour-\ning resources into expanding the reach of foreign-facing media\noutlets in the region.137 Chinese government-connected entities\nand their proxies have been holding summits, tours, and train-\nings with foreign journalists, encouraging them to echo Chinese\nnarratives while also controlling local traditional and new media\noutlets.138 China has become increasingly adept at utilizing local", "outlets.138 China has become increasingly adept at utilizing local\nlanguages to communicate its preferred narratives, focusing on\neconomic cooperation and providing positive stories on China.139\nIn addition to Arabic-language versions of official media such\nas CGTN, overseas Chinese networks like China-Arab TV serve\nofficial narratives as well, partnering with China\u2019s Central Pro-\npaganda Department to strengthen cooperation in film and TV\nproduction in order to \u201ctransmit China\u2019s voice\u201d and \u201cpromote Chi-\nna\u2019s image among Arab countries.\u201d 140 In 2022, the China Media\nGroup, a Chinese state media organization, and the Saudi Min-\nistry of Media launched a joint partnership initiative to promote\nrelations between Arab countries and China at the Arab-Chinese\nMedia Cooperation Forum.141 The initiative focuses on promoting\nthe presence of Chinese media in Arab channels and translating\nChinese television shows into Arabic for broadcast in the Palestin-", "Chinese television shows into Arabic for broadcast in the Palestin-\nian Territories, Algeria, Jordan, Sudan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.142\nChinese experts and state media have pushed a narrative that\nframes the United States\u2019 supposedly declining influence in the re-\ngion as an opportunity for Beijing to increase its engagement. For\nexample, a July 2022 article by Tang Zhichao, a professor at the\nUniversity of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, argued that\nthe Obama, Trump, and Biden Administrations were \u201cobsessed with\nstrategic competition among major powers and implemented a pol-\nicy of strategic contraction from the Middle East to achieve a shift\nto the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d which he claims created a vacuum in re-\ngional power and security.143 Dr. Tang argues in a February 2024 ar-\nticle that during the 30 years of the post-Cold War era, \u201cthe United\nStates\u2019 hegemonic position in the Middle East has gradually fallen", "States\u2019 hegemonic position in the Middle East has gradually fallen\nfrom high to low,\u201d which has prompted regional countries to \u201cincreas-\ningly strengthen their strategic autonomy, providing an important\nopportunity for the strategic cooperation between China, Russia and\nMiddle Eastern countries to be enhanced.\u201d 144 Gao Wencheng, a Xin-\nhua news reporter, also said in June 2023 that recently, \u201cfailure\u201d has\nbecome a common keyword when the international media discusses\nthe United States\u2019 Middle East policy, claiming the United States\nhas lost the \u201chearts of the people\u201d in the region due to \u201cwanton bul-\nlying.\u201d 145\n351\nSupporting Iran and Terrorist Groups to Undermine the\nUnited States\nChina and Iran share strong opposition to the U.S.-led liberal in-\nternational order.146 As it does with other countries in the region,\nChina takes an opportunistic approach to its relationship with\nIran.147 China will show solidarity with Iran to the degree that it", "Iran.147 China will show solidarity with Iran to the degree that it\ncomes at little cost to Beijing; at the same time, it takes advantage\nof Iran\u2019s isolated position, buying discounted oil and failing to fully\ndeliver on promised investments.148 Dr. Alterman argues that China\nleverages tensions between the United States and Iran, preferring\n\u201ca world in which the United States is bogged down in the Middle\nEast and alienates much of the Global South through its actions\nthere.\u201d 149 China has shown support to Iran through its rhetorical,\nmilitary, and economic actions, all of which serve to undermine U.S.\ninterests in the region.\nBeijing Props Up Tehran with Rhetorical and Diplomatic\nSupport\nChina has played a significant role in easing Iran\u2019s diplomatic iso-\nlation in recent years, particularly through its efforts to shield Iran\nfrom further sanctions over its nuclear program.

While China does not yet appear intent on replacing the\nUnited States as the dominant outside power in the region, it acts\nopportunistically to undermine U.S. influence. China\u2019s approach to\nthe region is mixed, seeking to strike a balance between undertak-\ning efforts that may undermine the influence of the United States\nwhile maintaining a threshold of stability necessary to ensure un-\nabated commercial activity. China may also believe that it benefits if\ncontinued regional turmoil deflects some U.S. energy and attention\naway from its own immediate periphery. However, China\u2019s substan-\ntial economic and commercial interests in the region, and its reli-", "tial economic and commercial interests in the region, and its reli-\nance on key trade routes that pass through it, leave it exposed to\npotential disruption if a significant conflict among regional powers\nwere to break out.\nDiplomatically, the Middle East presents an opportunity for China\nto promote its vision of global leadership. First, China is developing\ndeeper relations with both U.S. partners and rivals in the region.\nSecond, Beijing uses its three initiatives, the Global Security Initia-\ntive, Global Development Initiative, and Global Civilization Initia-\ntive, to engage Arab states and to present an alternative vision that\nappeals to the region\u2019s autocratic governments. Lastly, China uses\nmultilateral forums, such as the China-Arab States Cooperation Fo-\nrum, to spread narratives and gain support for issues such as its\nhuman rights abuses in Xinjiang or bolster its territorial claims in\nthe South China Sea or Taiwan.", "human rights abuses in Xinjiang or bolster its territorial claims in\nthe South China Sea or Taiwan.\nIran is also a crucial element of China\u2019s efforts to undermine the\nUnited States and the rules-based international order it leads. Chi-\nna and Iran harbor a shared sense of grievance toward the U.S.-\nled world order. By sustaining Iran\u2014and, indirectly, its proxy forces\nthroughout the region\u2014Beijing complicates the security landscape\nfor the United States and supports an effective counterweight to\nrising regional powers on the Arabian Peninsula. Chinese purchas-\nes of sanctioned Iranian crude oil have increased dramatically in\nrecent years, to the point where China now purchases nearly 90\npercent of Iranian oil and in doing so has established a network of\n380\nlogistical and financial institutions to bypass U.S. and international\nsanctions regimes against Iran.416 This evolving and increasingly\nsophisticated sanctions circumvention scheme is eroding the eco-", "sophisticated sanctions circumvention scheme is eroding the eco-\nnomic leverage the United States and the international community\ncan bring to bear not only to contain Iran but also to use against\nother adversarial states like Russia and North Korea, who together\nwith China are forming what researchers at the Atlantic Council\nhave dubbed the \u201caxis of evasion.\u201d 417 However, China\u2019s partnership\nwith Iran has limits, as China acts exploitatively to purchase Irani-\nan oil that cannot easily be sold to other buyers due to sanctions at\nbelow-market prices, all while signaling Beijing\u2019s unwillingness to\nenmesh too deeply for fear of souring relations with Saudi Arabia,\nthe UAE, and other important actors.418\nAnother area of increasing concern for the United States pertains\nto China\u2019s ability to acquire cutting-edge U.S. technology subject to\nexport controls given the presence of Chinese technology companies\nin the region\u2019s digital infrastructure, particularly in the Arab Gulf.", "in the region\u2019s digital infrastructure, particularly in the Arab Gulf.\nHuawei, ZTE, and other companies on the Commerce Department\u2019s\nEntity List have been instrumental in the buildout of telecommu-\nnications and cloud infrastructure across the region. With the rapid\nadvent of generative AI and the ambition of Saudi Arabia, the UAE,\nand other wealthy Gulf states to become AI leaders, there is acceler-\nating demand for dual-use hardware and software supplied by lead-\ning tech companies. In October 2023, the Commerce Department\nexpanded semiconductor export controls to require licenses for sale\nof cutting-edge chips to certain Middle Eastern countries, including\nthe UAE and Saudi Arabia, consistent with prior rules to prevent\nChinese military end use.419 Microsoft and the UAE\u2019s leading AI\nfirm Group 42 reached a landmark agreement in April 2024 that\nfollowed the latter\u2019s commitment to untangle ties with Chinese tech\ncompanies, including Huawei. This case is informative regarding", "companies, including Huawei. This case is informative regarding\nhow best to incentivize key partners with whom the United States\nmaintains close security relationships to effectively constrict poten-\ntial conduits of technology transfer to China.\nLastly, though China maintains a modest maritime security pres-\nence in the Middle East operating out of its base in Djibouti, it has\nyet to forward-deploy the forces necessary to conduct military oper-\nations that could rival the U.S. security architecture in the region. It\nappears for now that Beijing is content to free-ride off the security\nthat U.S. counterpiracy operations, counterterrorism operations, and\nbroader security partnerships provide in the region. China may also\nbe considering options for new bases in the region; for example, the\nU.S. Department of Defense asserted in 2023 that China has proba-\nbly considered the UAE for a PLA logistics facility.420 This and sim-", "bly considered the UAE for a PLA logistics facility.420 This and sim-\nilar port construction projects undertaken by Chinese companies in\nareas of strategic importance should be closely monitored, as should\narms sales and increasing military ties between the PLA and coun-\ntries in the region.\n381\nENDNOTES FOR CHAPTER 5\n1.

Today,\nChina continues to flood global markets with exports in an attempt\nto boost its domestic economic growth while simultaneously pursu-\ning the development of emerging technologies to assert its global\ngeopolitical interests and spur military modernization. In response,\nthe United States\u2019 economic approach toward China is evolving to\ncombat China\u2019s state-led, non-market practices. The United States\u2019\ntoolkit for addressing these challenges includes trade policy tools,\nsuch as tariffs on imports from China, controls on the transfer of\ntechnology, and restrictions on inbound and outbound investment", "technology, and restrictions on inbound and outbound investment\nthat might advance China\u2019s development of sensitive technologies.\nAt the same time, there remains a lack of consensus on the scope\nand implementation of these measures. Lacking an overarching set\nof objectives and a comprehensive strategy for achieving them, some\npolicies are implemented at cross-purposes, weakening the United\nStates\u2019 approach to economic competition with China. Unlike the\nNational Security Strategy (NSS), the United States does not yet\nhave a unified strategy organizing its approach to economic security.\nThe effectiveness of the United States\u2019 economic security strategy\nfaces further limits at present from a lack of data and analytic ca-\npabilities as well as a lack of adequate alignment of policies with\nkey allies and partners.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 U.S. trade policy is a key tool for defending against China\u2019s\nnon-market economic practices, diversifying U.S. supply chains,", "non-market economic practices, diversifying U.S. supply chains,\nand preserving U.S. economic security.\n\u2022 Efforts to de-risk supply chains are undermined by a lack of a\ncohesive trade policy as well as the continued presence of Chi-\nnese value-added content in non-Chinese imports.\n\u2022 As China increasingly asserts itself as a significant military\npower, export controls have emerged as a central tool in U.S.\nefforts to deny China direct access to critical dual-use goods\nand advancements in national security-sensitive technologies.\nHowever, a number of operational challenges diminish their\neffectiveness, including lack of coordination among key allies,\ncompliance challenges, and uneven enforcement.\n\u2022 While Congress in 2018 strengthened the U.S. inbound invest-\nment screening mechanism, it considered but did not implement\nmatching rules on outbound investments. In the last few years,\n(403)\n404\npolicymakers have actively explored creating an outbound in-", "(403)\n404\npolicymakers have actively explored creating an outbound in-\nvestment screening mechanism. Such a mechanism would curb\nimportant U.S. economic support to China\u2019s advanced technol-\nogy ambitions, such as the transfer of management expertise,\nknow-how, and capital that is unaddressed by the United States\u2019\nexisting toolkit, including a yet-to-be-implemented executive or-\nder (EO).\n\u2022 A lack of adequate detailed data on U.S. trade and investment\nflows poses an acute challenge to effective policy scoping and\nimplementation.\n\u2022 Economic partners in the G7 and other developed markets\nhave implemented trade measures to address trade distortions\ncaused by China\u2019s state-led economy; these measures continue\nto evolve. They are also exploring parallel export controls and\noutbound investment screening policies to limit the flow of key\ntechnologies. At times, the United States has had difficulty ob-\ntaining alignment with allies, which can undercut the effective-", "taining alignment with allies, which can undercut the effective-\nness of U.S. policy and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.\nRecommendations\nThe Commission recommends:\n\u2022 Congress consider legislation to eliminate federal tax expendi-\ntures for investments in Chinese companies on the Entity List\nmaintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, or identified\nas a Chinese military company on either the \u201cNon-Specially\nDesignated National (SDN) Chinese Military-Industrial Com-\nplex Companies List\u201d maintained by the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury or the \u201cChinese military companies\u201d list maintained\nby the U.S. Department of Defense. Among the tax expenditures\nthat would be eliminated prospectively are the preferential cap-\nital gains tax rate, the capital loss carry-forward provisions, and\nthe treatment of carried interest.\n\u2022 To enhance the effectiveness of export controls, Congress should:\n\u25cb Improve the analytic and enforcement capabilities of the U.S.", "\u25cb Improve the analytic and enforcement capabilities of the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security\n(BIS) by providing resources necessary to hire more in-house\nexperts; establish a Secretary\u2019s Fellows Program to more ef-\nfectively attract interagency talent; expand partnerships with\nthe national labs; increase access to data and data analysis\ntools, including the acquisition of proprietary datasets and\nmodern data analytic systems; and hire additional agents and\nanalysts for the Office of Export Enforcement.\n\u25cb Amend the Export Control Reform Act to require that within\n30 days of granting a license for export to entities on the\nEntity List, including under the Foreign Direct Product Rule,\nBIS shall provide all relevant information about the license\napproval to the relevant congressional committees, subject to\nrestrictions on further disclosure under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 4820(h)(2)\n(B)(ii).\n\u25cb Direct the president to:\n405", "(B)(ii).\n\u25cb Direct the president to:\n405\n\u0083 Designate a senior official to coordinate efforts across the\nAdministration to prioritize bilateral and multilateral sup-\nport for U.S. export control initiatives; and\n\u0083 Establish a Joint Interagency Task Force, reporting to and\noverseen by the national security advisor and with its own\nbudget and staff, to assess ways to achieve the goal of lim-\niting China\u2019s access to and development of advanced tech-\nnologies that pose a national security risk to the United\nStates. The task force should include designees from the\nU.S. Departments of Commerce, Defense, State, Treasury,\nand Energy; the intelligence community; and other relevant\nagencies. It should assess the effectiveness of existing ex-\nport controls; provide advice on designing new controls and/\nor using other tools to maximize their effect while mini-\nmizing their negative impact on U.S. and allied economies;\nand recommend new authorities, institutions, or interna-", "and recommend new authorities, institutions, or interna-\ntional arrangements in light of the long-term importance\nof U.S.-China technology competition.\n\u25cb Codify the \u201cSecuring the Information and Communications\nTechnology and Services Supply Chain\u201d Executive Order to\nensure that as the authority is used more robustly, challenges\nto its status as an executive order will not constrain BIS\u2019s\nimplementation decisions or delay implementation.\n\u2022 Congress direct the Administration to create an Outbound In-\nvestment Office within the executive branch to oversee invest-\nments into countries of concern, including China. The office\nshould have a dedicated staff and appropriated resources and\nbe tasked with:\n\u25cb Prohibiting outbound U.S. investment through a sector-based\napproach in technologies the United States has identified as\na threat to its national or economic security;\n\u25cb Expanding the list of covered sectors with the goal of aligning", "\u25cb Expanding the list of covered sectors with the goal of aligning\noutbound investment restrictions with export controls. The of-\nfice should identify and refine the list of covered technologies\nin coordination with appropriate agencies as new innovations\nemerge; and\n\u25cb Developing a broader mandatory notification program for sec-\ntors where investment is not prohibited to allow policymakers\nto accumulate visibility needed to identify potential high-risk\ninvestments and other sectors that pose a threat to U.S. na-\ntional or economic security. In addition to direct investments,\nthe notification regime should capture passive investment\nflows to help inform debates around the expansion of prohibi-\ntions to cover portfolio investment.\n\u2022 Congress repeal Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for\nChina. The PNTR status allows China to benefit from the same\ntrade terms as U.S. allies, despite engaging in practices such as\nintellectual property theft and market manipulation. Repealing", "intellectual property theft and market manipulation. Repealing\nPNTR could reintroduce annual reviews of China\u2019s trade prac-\ntices, giving the United States more leverage to address unfair\ntrade behaviors. This move would signal a shift toward a more\n406\nassertive trade policy aimed at protecting U.S. industries and\nworkers from economic coercion.\n\u2022 Congress direct relevant departments and agencies to expand\ntheir data collection and transparency initiatives into the vol-\nume and types of investment flowing into China by taking the\nfollowing actions:\n\u25cb Amending the International Investment and Trade in Ser-\nvices Survey Act to require the Bureau of Economic Analy-\nsis within the U.S. Department of Commerce to publish more\ndetailed sectoral breakdowns of U.S. direct investment in\nChina on a nationality basis and the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury to publish annual sector breakdowns of U.S. portfo-\nlio investment in China on a nationality basis. The portfolio", "lio investment in China on a nationality basis. The portfolio\ninvestment sectors should be more specific than those provid-\ned by the Commerce Department for direct investment. Ad-\nditionally, Congress should require the Treasury Department\nto publish quarterly updates\u2014without sector breakdowns\u2014of\nnationality-based portfolio investment in China.\n\u25cb Requiring the U.S. Department of Commerce to produce a\nreport on the feasibility and methodology for publishing na-\ntionality-based results for direct investment, where offshore\ntax havens and locales of incorporation would not be said to\nreceive hundreds of billions of dollars and true destinations\nof the capital would be accurately identified.\n\u2022 Congress direct the Administration to impose sanctions on\nChinese financial institutions that violate sanctions, includ-\ning those that are proven to be working with or supporting\nthe Russian military industrial base or facilitating purchases\nof Iranian oil.", "the Russian military industrial base or facilitating purchases\nof Iranian oil.\n\u2022 In light of the periodic and increasingly frequent removal of\nsome of these materials from Chinese websites, Congress direct\nthe executive branch to fund the creation and operation of a\nregularly updated, permanent data archive, in effect a series\nof snapshots of portions of the Chinese internet. In the past\ndecade, foreign analysts have made use of open source Chi-\nnese-language materials to gain insight into various aspects of\ncurrent policy as well as internal (but unclassified) discussions\nof future military, diplomatic, and economic strategy. Informa-\ntion would be stored in the permanent data archive, accessible\nto both government and private analysts.\n\u2022 Congress consider legislation to set priorities and goals for\nU.S.-China economic relations. These policy priorities and goals\nshould include:\n\u25cb Updating existing trade and economic tools to ensure their", "should include:\n\u25cb Updating existing trade and economic tools to ensure their\ntimely application, utility, and effectiveness in countering\nChina\u2019s non-market economic policies;\n\u25cb Limiting U.S. economic and security dependence on supply\nchains in critical and emerging products, technologies, and\nservices provided by companies controlled, operating in, or\nsubject to the influence of China;\n407\n\u25cb Enhancing the accountability of the executive branch to Con-\ngress and increasing the transparency of its actions to ensure\ncoordinated governmental action and respect for Congress\u2019s\nconstitutional Article I, Section 8 authority;\n\u25cb Prioritizing domestic production and employment while also\nrecognizing the need, as appropriate, to coordinate and align\npolicies with friends and allies;\n\u25cb Acting to address production overcapacity fueled by Chinese\npolicies and actions; and\n\u25cb Advancing the resilience of the U.S. economy and ensuring its\naccess to key inputs and technologies.", "access to key inputs and technologies.\n\u2022 Congress pass legislation eliminating the ability of entities op-\nerating in U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZs) to qualify for zero\nor lower tariffs on products imported from China or Chinese-af-\nfiliated or -invested entities into the FTZ and then reexported.\n\u2022 The relevant committees of Congress hold hearings to assess\nthe desirability and feasibility of creating a trade defense coa-\nlition with other like-minded countries to forestall the risk of a\nsecond China shock. Such a grouping would seek to align poli-\ncies for responding to the recent acceleration in China\u2019s exports\nof subsidized, underpriced materials and manufactured goods.\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, U.S. policymakers have begun to rethink many of\nthe assumptions that undergirded the previous several decades of\ntrade and economic engagement with China. While China undertook\nsome measures to reform its economy in ways to promote private", "some measures to reform its economy in ways to promote private\nenterprise and foreign investment, such measures invariably proved\nsecondary to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) core goals of\nremaining in power, strengthening its economy and military power\nand growing China\u2019s global influence. The CCP never intended to\ncede control of China\u2019s economy to market forces.\nEarly indications suggest that attempts by the United States to\nlimit China\u2019s access to and development of certain dual-use and\nfoundational technologies, promote de-risking, and address econom-\nic distortions and unfair trade practices from China have had some\nsuccess. But even as a growing array of policy tools are being de-\nployed to evolve U.S. economic, trade, and related national security\npolicy toward China, the U.S. economy remains deeply intertwined\nwith China\u2019s. There is a need for a more comprehensive policy re-\nalignment\u2014including a review of trade tools, export controls, and", "alignment\u2014including a review of trade tools, export controls, and\ninvestment restrictions\u2014as well as a significantly greater effort to\nalign these measures with those of allies and like-minded countries\nin order to ensure their efficacy.\nThis chapter begins with a review of how China continues to pur-\nsue its economic interests in ways inconsistent with global norms\nof fair trade. The chapter then reviews the United States\u2019 response\nto China\u2019s action across three arenas: trade policy, export controls,\nand investment screening. The chapter draws on the Commission\u2019s\nMay 2024 hearing on \u201cKey Economic Strategies for Leveling the\n408\nU.S.-China Playing Field: Trade, Investment, and Technology,\u201d con-\nsultations with experts, and open source research and analysis.\nEconomic Security as a Whole-of-Government\nApproach\nOver the past three decades, U.S. economic policy toward China\nwas substantially developed and implemented in functional silos.", "was substantially developed and implemented in functional silos.\nThe United States tailored policy approaches based on explicit con-\ncerns\u2014such as specific market access challenges, intellectual prop-\nerty (IP) theft, or steel and aluminum overcapacity\u2014so as not to de-\nrail broader economic cooperation or to slow what was widely hoped\nto be a process of liberalization by China.1\nGiven this, U.S. strategy and implementation of its key econom-\nic tools were also siloed. U.S. officials were aware that China\u2019s\nnon-market economic practices frequently advantaged Chinese com-\npanies at the expense of U.S. firms and workers and resulted in\nsignificant shifts in supply chains. However, optimism that a com-\nplex and interdependent global economy would deter conflict and\nliberalize China tempered the U.S. response and kept the focus on\nmore narrow industry-specific issues or better enforcement of exist-\ning trade rules.2 Similarly, despite periodic concerns that technology", "ing trade rules.2 Similarly, despite periodic concerns that technology\ntransfers might be assisting the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s military\nmodernization drive, until very recently this was viewed as an issue\nfor narrow export controls on weapons and dual-use products, not\na reason to broadly challenge China\u2019s innovation ecosystem or limit\nflows of U.S. capital and know-how that helped build up China\u2019s\ntechnological capabilities in critical and emerging technologies.3\nMany policymakers have come to believe that the size, scale, and\ncomplexity of China\u2019s challenge to U.S. interests requires more in-\ntense coordination between economic and national security goals.4\nThe United States, however, has not reshaped its architecture of\neconomic tools accordingly despite a consensus that China is now\na whole-of-government problem.5 While the United States has pur-\nsued numerous actions to refine and improve the tools it uses to\naddress the trade, technology, and investment challenges it faces", "address the trade, technology, and investment challenges it faces\nfrom China, its actions remain fundamentally siloed.\nU.S. export controls on advanced chips illustrate the risks of the\ncurrent approach.

These issues span China\u2019s non-market abuses and economic\ncoercion, China\u2019s partially closed economy and growing technolog-\nical capabilities, and China\u2019s global economic importance and the\nbenefits it reaps from the open international economic order.12 Yet", "benefits it reaps from the open international economic order.12 Yet\neven with this recognition of China-related challenges, there is no\ncomparable strategy on the economic side that defines a clear set\nof principles and goals to guide restructuring of the United States\u2019\neconomic relationship with China, foster coordination across varied\ndepartments and policy tools, and drive development of the tools\nthat will be needed.\nDeploying Tariffs and Other Trade Measures\nEmerging Consensus on Trade Policy Objectives toward\nChina\nKey priorities of U.S. trade policy since 1945, according to the Con-\ngressional Research Service, have included \u201c(1) fostering economic\ngrowth and securing more open, equitable, and reciprocal market\naccess for U.S. exports and investment; (2) protecting U.S. producers\nfrom unfair foreign trade practices and rapid surges in fairly traded\nimports; and (3) strengthening the rules-based multilateral trading", "imports; and (3) strengthening the rules-based multilateral trading\nsystem to help achieve the above objectives and further U.S. for-\neign policy.\u201d 13 Since 2017, however, the focus of U.S. trade policy has\nshifted in significant ways as the United States pivoted to address\nwhat it saw as rising economic challenges and flaws in the previous\npolicy framework, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis China.14 The United States\nhas increasingly deployed its trade policy instruments to address\nthree areas in the U.S.-China economic relationship:\n\u2022 China\u2019s harmful economic practices: Since China joined the\nWTO, the United States has largely sought to address the costs\nto the U.S. economy from China\u2019s non-market practices through\nbilateral engagement and multilateral mechanisms. Beijing\u2019s\nharmful policies include unfair subsidies, access to free or sub-\nsidized credit, and other non-trade barriers; coercive IP transfer\nand theft; and protectionism and market access restrictions.15", "and theft; and protectionism and market access restrictions.15\nDistortions in China\u2019s system have often led to significant over-\ncapacity, which, when combined with the open international\ntrading system, has enabled China\u2019s export-led growth model\nand injured market-based producers in other countries.16 In\n2018, Section 301 tariffs were unilaterally imposed to make\nprogress on these issues. This marked a shift from a previous\napproach based on bilateral and multilateral frameworks.17\n\u2022 Supply chain resilience: In response to growing geopolitical ten-\nsions and, later, shocks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nUnited States has intensified its efforts to address supply chain\nrisks and reduce reliance on Chinese production. As economist\n410\nEmily Blanchard observes, governments are no longer just in-\nterested in what goods and services enter or are sold within\ntheir borders but also are looking to reshape patterns of produc-", "their borders but also are looking to reshape patterns of produc-\ntion occurring outside their borders and even before domestic\nfirms may be involved, an approach that was not deeply consid-\nered when the WTO framework was established.18\n\u2022 The intersection of economic and national security: In recent\nyears, U.S. trade policy has aimed to address the United States\u2019\npersistent and massive trade deficit with China, the loss of U.S.\njobs and industry, and potential national security concerns aris-\ning from trade-related harm to domestic industries such as steel\nand aluminum.19 Ongoing policy debates center on how to de-\nploy trade measures to ensure the United States does not lose\ncritical industries to low-cost, state-supported, and non-market-\nbased competition from China.\nRecent U.S. Trade Measures\nSince 2017, the United States has promulgated a complex web of\ntrade measures to mitigate harms from Chinese imports in an at-", "trade measures to mitigate harms from Chinese imports in an at-\ntempt to create a more level playing field. Authorities under Section\n301 of the Trade Act of 1974 were used to undertake an expansion\nin tariffs that was unprecedented in recent history. Alongside these\nactions, the United States also turned to Section 201 of the Trade\nAct of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to protect\ndomestic industry, including from harmful Chinese economic prac-\ntices. At the same time, U.S. industry expanded use of quasi-judicial\ntrade remedy tools such as antidumping investigations, which were\nthe source of most pre-2017 additional tariffs on imports from China\nfollowing its accession to the WTO.20 By the end of 2020, the United\nStates\u2019 trade-weighted average tariff on Chinese products (including\nantidumping duties) was 26.7 percent, compared to 8.4 percent at\nthe start of 2018.* 21\nSection 201 Action on Washing Machines and Solar Panels", "the start of 2018.* 21\nSection 201 Action on Washing Machines and Solar Panels\nOn February 7, 2018, the United States placed duties on imports\nof washing machines and solar cells and modules under Section 201\nof the Trade Act of 1974, the first imposition of Section 201 tariffs\nsince 2001.22 According to economic historian Douglas Irwin, Sec-\ntion 201 was meant to be \u201cthe principal means by which industries\nharmed by imports could receive temporary relief from foreign com-\npetition.\u201d 23 If the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) de-\ntermines following an investigation that a product\u2019s import volume\nis a \u201csubstantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to\nthe domestic industry,\u201d the U.S. president can then decide to impose\ntrade restrictions.24 Relief under Section 201 is meant to serve as\na temporary \u201cglobal\u201d safeguard, meaning import restrictions for a\nparticular product or industry are applied to imports from all coun-", "particular product or industry are applied to imports from all coun-\n* The antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) assessed by the United States tended\nto be substantially higher than tariffs under Section 301.

China\u2019s government absorbed\nsome of the cost of the U.S. tariffs by reducing taxes on domestic\nexport manufacturers. China decreased the gross value-added tax\n(VAT) rate from 17 percent in 2018 to 13 percent by the end of\n2020 while also increasing the VAT rebate on exports over the\nsame time period.85 The share of Chinese exports that faced an\neffective VAT rate of zero increased from 5 percent in 2017 to", "effective VAT rate of zero increased from 5 percent in 2017 to\nabout 50 percent by the end of 2020.86 China also made it eas-\nier for firms to access its processing trade regime, under which\nmanufacturers approved by Chinese authorities can import in-\nputs duty free, provided they are used to produce exports.87 After\n2018, the share of U.S. imports that entered China as processing\ntrade rose sharply, suggesting that firms made greater use of the\ncustoms arrangement to negate the impact of tariffs; notably, the\nprocessing trade share of imports from other countries remained\nlargely unchanged.88 Nevertheless, the sum of China\u2019s responses\nled to a diversion of imports away from the United States\u2014by\n2023, the United States was the source for just 6.5 percent of\nChina\u2019s total imports, down from 7.3 percent before 2018.89\nThe existing U.S. tariff architecture is not well-suited to deter the\nimport of products made in other countries using Chinese compo-", "import of products made in other countries using Chinese compo-\nnents, creating an opportunity for Chinese exporters to continue\naccessing the U.S. market by moving final assembly outside of Chi-\nna. The Section 301 tariffs on China are designed to duty imports\ndirectly from China-based producers. However, under the methodol-\nogy typically used to determine duty rates, the tariffs generally do\nnot apply to exporters based outside of China that utilize Chinese\ncomponents, provided that the inputs are modified in such a way to\nmeet the customs standard for the applicable rule of origin (often\nrequiring a \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d).90 This creates a situation\nwhere the United States may continue to import Chinese value-add-\ned content embedded via third-country supply chain linkages.

According to Dr. Lovely, these\nSection 301 actions placed greater focus on less knowledge-intensive\nand more labor-intensive sectors.97 Because of the expansive scope\nof the measures, she assessed in testimony before the Commission\nthat \u201cU.S. trade policy objectives have not been clearly linked to the\ntrade policy instruments we currently deploy.\u201d 98 Some argue that\nsuch a broad approach is necessary to respond to the pervasiveness\nof China\u2019s non-market practices, while others advocate for focusing\nU.S. trade restrictions on a set of products with national security\nimplications and removing barriers to trade with China in less stra-\ntegically important areas.99 Following the USTR\u2019s 2024 Section 301", "tegically important areas.99 Following the USTR\u2019s 2024 Section 301\nreview, the U.S. government maintained and selectively reviewed\nthe existing broad-ranging tariff measures, and it also selectively\nexpanded the tariff measures to industries where surging Chinese\nmanufacturing capacity posed a clear threat to ongoing efforts to\nbolster U.S. domestic production.100\nThe China Section 301 tariffs impacted foreign firms in China and\nraised production costs for U.S.-based firms with Chinese supply\nchains, reflecting the challenge of targeting tariffs solely at Chinese\nproducers that benefit from state support. In their review of the\nSection 301 tariff list, Dr. Lovely and Dr. Liang found that products\ntargeted for tariffs were primarily sourced from foreign affiliates\noperating in China, with the exception of tariffs on China\u2019s chemical\nsector (see textbox on \u201cChinese Supply Chains Are Reducing Depen-\ndence on Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs)\u201d).101 In the aggregate,\n420", "dence on Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs)\u201d).101 In the aggregate,\n420\ntotal U.S. trade with China only amounted to 3.2 percent of U.S.\ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2018, meaning most U.S. economic\nactivity had limited reliance on China.* 102 The Section 301 tariffs\ndid increase production costs for U.S. firms using China as an ex-\nport production platform or using intermediate inputs from China.\nCosts for U.S.-based producers that relied on supply chains linked to\nChina also rose. By 2020, 93 percent of Chinese intermediate goods\nimports were subject to higher duties, compared to 69 percent of\nconsumer goods and 47 percent of capital equipment.103 One study\nfound that for U.S. exporting firms with supply chain links to China,\nthe tariffs on imported inputs effectively acted as a 2 percent tariff\non their exports.\u2020 104 The USTR engaged in an exclusion review pro-\ncess to mitigate these effects.

In addition, an increased number of\nU.S.-based exporters applied to operate within a U.S. foreign trade\nzone (FTZ), which provides lower tariffs for imported inputs incorpo-\nrated into exported products. The share of U.S. merchandise imports\nfrom China entering under special duty provisions for warehousing\nor an FTZ increased from 11 percent in 2017 to 17 percent in 2023,\nwith a total of $75 billion in inputs entering these zones.\u2021 105\nChinese Supply Chains Are Reducing Dependence on\nForeign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs)\nForeign (non-Chinese) firms in China have historically been an\nimportant source of China\u2019s exports.

China\u2019s leadership has\nrepeatedly expressed anxiety about its reliance on certain high-end\nelectronic components and specialized steel alloys that are manufac-\ntured by a small number of U.S. or allied companies; these inputs\ncurrently have no viable high-end Chinese competitors and will like-\nly take years or more to duplicate.131\nPlurilateral vs. Unilateral Export Controls\nDue to the interconnected nature of the global trade ecosystem\nand the lack of tangible methods to track or control the final des-\ntinations of physical goods, the effectiveness and sustainability of\nexport controls relies on the cooperation of allies and partners. The\nUnited States has traditionally preferred to take a multilateral ap-\nproach to export controls for three reasons.132 First, this approach", "proach to export controls for three reasons.132 First, this approach\nensures maximum effectiveness of controls since the controls block\ntrade from a broader range of potential sources of the technology for\nthe targeted country or entity.133 Second, a multilateral approach\nimproves enforcement; absent geolocation solutions that could re-\nmotely shut off technology if it travels outside of a proscribed area,\npreventing reexport of restricted goods relies on allied cooperation,\ntracking, and enforcement systems.134 Third, broad adherence to a\nuniform set of controls ensures that firms in other countries do not\nmerely \u201cbackfill\u201d U.S. exports, which would both limit the effective-\nness of the controls and potentially harm U.S. interests by redirect-\ning revenue needed to sustain R&D away from U.S. firms to their\ninternational competitors.135 In the long run, unilateral controls can\ncreate a structural regulatory and economic incentive for U.S. com-", "create a structural regulatory and economic incentive for U.S. com-\npanies and their foreign competitors to develop technologies outside\nthe United States with non-U.S. technology and content. This would\nundercut the U.S. export control goal of maintaining the country\u2019s\ntechnological leadership.\nExperience, however, indicates that U.S. leadership on export con-\ntrols via unilateral implementation can convince allied countries to\nfollow. Allied countries contend with their own domestic interests\nthat are concerned about losing access to profitable markets. When\nthe United States implements export controls ahead of allied coun-\ntries, this can help allied governments overcome domestic political\nconstraints.136 Plurilateral controls also face constraints based on\nthe varying legal powers of foreign governments and the resources\navailable to devote to enforcement and ongoing international coop-\neration.137\nThe October 2022 controls on advanced semiconductor and semi-", "eration.137\nThe October 2022 controls on advanced semiconductor and semi-\nconductor manufacturing equipment exports to China provide an\nexample.138 While U.S. companies design some of the most sophis-\n426\nticated semiconductors and are among the leaders in semiconduc-\ntor manufacturing equipment, companies in Europe and East Asia\nalso play critical roles in the production of the chips themselves and\ncertain high-end chip-making equipment.139 Initially, the October\n2022 rules were imposed unilaterally by the United States, though\nthey did expand restrictions and licensing requirements on some\nforeign-produced items.140 Aware of the need to multilateralize the\nrules for effectiveness, the United States designed the rules in con-\nsultation with key allies and worked to bring them along. Japan\nand the Netherlands, home to a number of companies key to ad-\nvanced semiconductor production, have since imposed similar con-\ntrols based on the U.S. rollout.141 By moving first, the United States", "trols based on the U.S. rollout.141 By moving first, the United States\nwas able to quickly target China\u2019s ability to purchase key semicon-\nductor manufacturing equipment supplied by the United States,\nwhich could have enabled more advanced domestic semiconductor\nmanufacturing capability.142 With the United States having demon-\nstrated commitment to sacrificing some short-term economic gain\nfor longer-term security, the Netherlands and Japan also agreed to\nlimit their own exports of advanced equipment to China and to ab-\nstain from developing products that would have otherwise filled the\ngap left by U.S. firms.143 In April 2024, Japan expanded its export\ncontrols to include additional types of semiconductor manufacturing\nequipment, following the United States\u2019 lead in its October 2023\nexpansion of its semiconductor controls.144\nStill, most other countries have not imposed export controls to the\nsame extent as the United States. Many countries currently lack a", "same extent as the United States. Many countries currently lack a\nlegal regime that allows them to target controls to specific entities of\nconcern versus broader country-targeted controls, which have been\nthe traditional approach of multilateral regimes. Other countries\nhave also been hesitant to adopt analogues to the \u201cU.S. persons\u201d\ncontrols, which limit the ability of U.S. individuals and companies\nto support Chinese semiconductor development and ongoing servic-\ning of certain equipment. While Japan\u2019s enhanced export controls\non semiconductor equipment apply to all exports, not just China\u2019s,\nand Japan does implement catch-all end user restrictions related to\nthe exports of certain technologies, it does not prohibit non-resident\nJapanese persons from servicing existing semiconductor machinery.\nThe United States has pressed both Japan and the Netherlands\nto implement restrictions on ongoing maintenance and servicing\nof chip-making equipment already in China, without which their", "of chip-making equipment already in China, without which their\nongoing ability to produce cutting-edge chips would deteriorate.145\nThis concern is significant given the capabilities and large amount\nof semiconductor manufacturing equipment China procured both be-\nfore the controls were announced and between the announcement\nand when it went into effect.146\nTraditional multilateral frameworks for export controls, set up\nto control conventional and nuclear weapons, have not adapted\nwell to modern challenges of dual-use technologies and changes in\ngeopolitical realities.* The four existing multilateral export con-\ntrol regimes are informal arrangements whereby member coun-\ntries can coordinate policies and exchange information and best\n* See Appendix I, \u201cCurrent Multilateral Export Control Regimes\u201d for a list of the current export\ncontrol regimes.\n427\npractices for various types of weapons-related products and tech-\nnologies.147 Each regime is consensus-based and does not have", "nologies.147 Each regime is consensus-based and does not have\nlegally binding rules. Some regimes have only limited self-report-\ning on adherence. Additionally, a drawback of consensus-based\nregimes is that a single state can veto important decisions like\nadmitting new members or updating the control lists. Since 2021,\nRussia has effectively neutralized new decisions under the Was-\nsenaar Arrangement, which serves to control dual-use items in\naddition to conventional arms.148\nBilateral and mini-lateral coordination could provide one solution,\nparticularly for technologies with only a few commercial producers.\nNegotiations and controls could move faster, be nimbler, and poten-\ntially involve higher levels of coordination by having fewer coun-\ntries involved.149 As the United States has conferred with nations\nin smaller settings, a new consensus has emerged on the need to\ncontrol items such as semiconductors. The informal cooperation be-", "control items such as semiconductors. The informal cooperation be-\ntween the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands with respect\nto semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment\ncontrols provides an example of the benefits of and possibilities for\nmini-lateral approaches. In a statement after a trilateral meeting\nwith representatives from Japan and South Korea, the Department\nof Commerce affirmed the national security significance of semicon-\nductors and referenced the role of the trilateral U.S.-Japan-Repub-\nlic of Korea Disruptive Technology Protection Network, launched\nin April 2024, in combating illicit technology transfer.150 Another\nexample is the Trilateral Security Partnership between the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, and Australia (AUKUS).

Progress in AUKUS\nhas reportedly been slowed by the gap between the United States\u2019\ncontrols and those of the UK and Australia.153\nExport Control Outcomes at the U.S.-EU Trade and\nTechnology Council\nThe U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) has helped\nadvance transatlantic communication on export controls in some\naspects, such as evasion and diversion efforts in exports to Rus-\nsia and Iran, but significant challenges remain in coordinating", "sia and Iran, but significant challenges remain in coordinating\ncontrols on sensitive technology flows to China.

Nevertheless, both official and\nprivate data sources suggest that while total U.S. outbound invest-\nment flows to China have substantially declined in recent years, di-\nrect investment in particular has become increasingly concentrated\nin innovative sectors with implications for U.S. national security.203\nOfficial U.S. Data on U.S. Outbound Investments into China\nAt the end of 2023, U.S. official data showed the total U.S. di-\nrect investment stock in mainland China to be $126.9 billion.204\nIncluding Hong Kong and Macau, U.S. direct investment rises to", "Including Hong Kong and Macau, U.S. direct investment rises to\n$218.5 billion, or 3.3 percent of total U.S. direct investment stock.205\nAs of 2022, the most recent year with complete data, accumulated\nU.S. portfolio investment stock in mainland China was a much more\nsizable $712 billion.206 Including Hong Kong and Macau, U.S. port-\nfolio investment stock rises to $910 billion ($860 billion in equity\ninvestments and $50 billion in bonds), or 8.5 percent of U.S. foreign\ninvestment stock.207\nIn recent years, the growth of U.S. direct investment into China\nhas steadily declined.

Despite increased government interest in an outbound\ninvestment regime, U.S. investors remain keenly interested in\nsupporting and investing in China\u2019s semiconductors, quantum\ncomputing, and AI sectors.230 In the first half of 2024, U.S. direct\ninvestment in those sectors had already surpassed the total value\nof 2023.231\nPrivate sector data sources do not provide estimates of the total\nallocation of U.S. portfolio investments in China by sector.232", "allocation of U.S. portfolio investments in China by sector.232\nImpact of Restricting U.S. Direct and Portfolio Investment\nRestricting U.S. direct or portfolio investment would have differ-\nent impacts on China\u2019s innovation ecosystem. Halting the flow of\ndirect investment to specific sectors within the Chinese economy\nwould diminish certain companies\u2019 access to funding and the intan-\ngible benefits often associated with venture capital firms and ear-\nly-stage investors.233\nDirect investment often involves a long-term relationship that\ngives control over or a significant degree of influence on the man-\nagement of an enterprise. Historically, China has enforced strin-\ngent restrictions on direct investment flows into the country and\nhas forced U.S. and other foreign businesses to acquiesce to joint\nventures with Chinese firms and sign over their IP and technology\nto access the Chinese market.234 Because of the strategic nature of", "to access the Chinese market.234 Because of the strategic nature of\nthe investment, in addition to providing capital or technology, U.S.\ninvestors often also provide intangible benefits to recipient compa-\nnies, including an enhanced global reputation, managerial expertise,\ntalent networks, a deep understanding of technology, and U.S. mar-\nket access.235\n* In calculating investment size, Dr. Danzman specifically defines these sectors to include semi-\nconductors, edge computing semiconductors, generative AI, post-quantum cryptography, quantum\ncomputing, quantum sensing, and swarm AI.\n\u2020 CSET researchers used Crunchbase as their data source instead of Pitchbook, which is the\nsource of the other non-greenfield investment statistics referenced earlier.

A num-\nber of debates around its scope also remain, including the types of\ninvestments that should be prohibited. A further challenge in shap-\ning the mechanism is the lack of data around U.S. investments into\nChina. The pervasive use of offshore tax havens and an inability to\naccess granular, sectoral data mean policymakers are flying blind\nwhen determining the scale and scope of investment prohibitions.", "when determining the scale and scope of investment prohibitions.\nHowever, the size and salience of China mean that no single U.S.\neconomic statecraft tool will be a panacea for the challenges its\neconomy poses. Trade measures, export controls and sanctions, and\ninvestment restrictions will need to work in tandem to achieve the\nUnited States\u2019 most ambitious and important goals. This means that\nthe policy work cannot end when each tool is adopted and stream-\nlined to address the issues in its specific domain. U.S officials must\ncontinuously dismantle bureaucratic siloes and compel implement-\ning agencies to work toward a unified strategy.\n440\nAppendix I: Current Multilateral Export\nControl

worsening relations and the con-\ntinued flow of U.S. investment into key Chinese technology sectors, the\nWhite House issued an EO, \u201cAddressing United States Investments\nin Certain National Security Technologies and Products in Countries\nof Concern,\u201d establishing an outbound investment regime.245 The EO\ntakes a sectoral approach focusing on U.S. investments in China across\na narrow set of technologies related to semiconductors and microelec-\ntronics, quantum information technologies, and AI systems.246 The EO\nis rooted in the authority granted to the president by the International\nEmergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).* 247", "Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).* 247\nShortly after the EO was released, the Treasury Department is-\nsued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) that\noutlined the proposed outbound investment regime and sought pub-\nlic comments.248 In July 2024, the ANPRM was followed up with\na Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which detailed the Ad-\nministration\u2019s current thinking on how to design and implement an\noutbound investment mechanism.\u2020 249\nThe program aims to limit investment by U.S. persons \u2021 in Chi-\nnese entities that are involved in\u2014or in certain circumstances may\nbecome involved in\u2014the development or production of covered tech-\nnologies.\u00a7 It would do this by proposing two categories of concern\nfor outbound direct investments: notifiable transactions that could\ncontribute to a national security threat and prohibited transactions\n* IEEPA grants the

U.S.C. \u00a7 1701(a).\n\u2020 While the ANPRM and the NPRM are very similar they do have a few important differences.\nThe definition of AI was harmonized to align with other EOs such as EO 14110. The NPRM\nelaborates on and refines some ambiguities around the knowledge standard (which describes the\nknowledge a U.S. person must have about certain facts and circumstances related to a transaction\nto trigger obligations under the proposed rule); clarifies applicability in very specific transactions\ntypes; provides a new exception for transactions involving persons of third countries that have\nsimilar measures aimed at outbound investments; and clarifies the scope of limited partner in-", "similar measures aimed at outbound investments; and clarifies the scope of limited partner in-\nvestments that would be covered by the proposed rule and those that would be excepted.

General Secretary of the CCP Xi\nJinping now believes China has entered a period of increased\nchallenges both domestically and internationally and has taken\na number of steps to better prepare the Party and country for\nthis period of threat and uncertainty. On the political front, Chi-\nnese leaders have broadened conceptions of national security to\nenhance the Party-state\u2019s power, build out the national security\nstate, and expand tools of societal control at the grassroots lev-\nel. On the military front, China\u2019s armed forces have improved\ntheir mechanisms for mobilizing available manpower, leveraging\nresources in the civilian economy, and priming the Chinese public\nto contribute to national defense. On the economic front, China\nhas implemented measures to strengthen food security, energy\nsecurity, and trade and financial security.\nChina\u2019s numerous and varied actions are driven by multiple goals,", "China\u2019s numerous and varied actions are driven by multiple goals,\nincluding the desire to suppress domestic challenges, prepare for a\nmore volatile and less open international economic environment, and\nposition itself effectively for long-term strategic competition with\nthe United States. At the same time, many of these actions serve\nto increase China\u2019s capacity for rapid military mobilization and re-\nsilience in the case of hostilities. Recent changes have made China\nsignificantly more prepared for war compared to five years ago while\npotentially obscuring the signals that would normally precede an\nimminent or near-term mobilization. These changes have already\naltered the strategic and operational environment in China\u2019s favor.\nChinese officials likely believe they have moderated the economic\ncosts the United States and its allies could impose on them through\nsanctions, blockades, and trade restrictions in the event there is an", "sanctions, blockades, and trade restrictions in the event there is an\noutbreak of hostilities, potentially reducing the deterrent effect of\nnon-military policy options and external constraints.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 China\u2019s leaders believe they have entered a new historical\nphase characterized by greater internal and external threats.\nThis heightened threat perception has fueled numerous poli-\ncy efforts to better prepare the Party, China\u2019s society, and the\nmilitary for what the Party believes will be a more hostile and\nuncertain period.\n(458)\n459\n\u2022 China\u2019s leaders have intensified their rhetoric about risk over\nthe last few years, increasingly invoking a concept called \u201cex-\ntreme scenario thinking\u201d that suggests Chinese policymakers\nare increasingly thinking through the potential ramifications of\na wide range of scenarios, including the repercussions of ac-\ntions they might initiate on the international stage. At the same\ntime, CCP rhetoric toward Taiwan and the United States has", "time, CCP rhetoric toward Taiwan and the United States has\nnot escalated to the degree that preceded China\u2019s conflicts in\npast decades or to what some experts expect to see if China\nwere imminently preparing for war.\n\u2022 China is continuing longstanding efforts to address concerns\nover food insecurity. China is largely self-sufficient in four of\nfive key staples, though it is becoming increasingly dependent\non corn and wheat imports. China relies on imports for the fifth\n(soybeans) and is overall a significant net food importer. China\nis believed to have the world\u2019s largest stockpiles of its key sta-\nples and has taken measures to diversify its soybean supplies\naway from the United States and reduce overall soybean con-\nsumption.\n\u2022 China is taking measures to enhance its energy security and\nto ensure it can address its oil energy needs for long periods of\ntime without imports. China is largely self-sufficient in coal, its\nprimary energy source for power generation, and it has devel-", "primary energy source for power generation, and it has devel-\noped a coal surge capacity to deal with temporary disruptions.\nPerhaps because natural gas is not a major part of China\u2019s en-\nergy mix, China seems less concerned about its significant reli-\nance on imports and only has a short-term stockpile of natural\ngas. China is heavily dependent on oil imports for transporta-\ntion and appears to be building very large stockpiles\u2014with es-\ntimates of one to two years\u2019 supply.\n\u2022 China is taking measures to enhance its financial security, chal-\nlenge global dollar dominance, and protect itself from U.S. fi-\nnancial sanctions by creating alternatives to dollar-based trade\nand the U.S.-controlled financial payments system. These efforts\nhave accelerated since the imposition of sanctions in the wake\nof Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine. While the ren-\nminbi (RMB) is not on pace to supplant the U.S. dollar as a me-\ndium of global exchange, China is developing these tools with", "dium of global exchange, China is developing these tools with\nthe intention to insulate itself from many types of U.S. financial\nsanctions.\n\u2022 Party leaders have developed an exceedingly broad concep-\ntion of national security and expanded their tools for domes-\ntic control. These include an increasingly robust internal se-\ncurity apparatus, the revival of some Maoist-era methods of\nmass mobilization, and efforts to leverage the public for sur-\nveillance and control, including by outsourcing public secu-\nrity tasks to government-sanctioned \u201cvigilante groups.\u201d This\nheightened focus on security has been formalized through\nan expansion of relevant legal infrastructure, with new laws\ndefining national security as touching upon virtually every\naspect of society.\n460\n\u2022 There is currently no evidence that China is preparing for an\nimminent war, but the various reforms China has made to its\ndefense mobilization system over time undeniably make it more", "defense mobilization system over time undeniably make it more\nconfident and prepared for hostilities than it was five years ago.\nMany of these measures reduce the time needed for China to\nmobilize and transition from peacetime or gray zone activities\nto active hostilities and could be read as efforts to prepare the\noperational environment for a conflict over Taiwan. Given the\ndecreasing amount of open source data available about China,\nthe United States and international observers will have less\nvisibility of warnings and indicators that may presage Chinese\nmilitary action, a shorter timeline to react once indicators are\ndiscovered, and fewer non-military tools to respond.\nRecommendations\nThe Commission recommends:\n\u2022 Congress direct the Office of the Director of National Intelli-\ngence, within 180 days, to conduct a classified assessment, and\nbrief its findings to Congress, of the intelligence community\u2019s\n(IC) ability to accurately monitor strategic, nonmilitary indica-", "(IC) ability to accurately monitor strategic, nonmilitary indica-\ntors that would signal that China is preparing for imminent\nconflict and the extent to which China\u2019s increasing lack of trans-\nparency affects the IC\u2019s ability to monitor this information.

Likewise, China\nhas exhausted the patience of major economies and trading partners\nwho are no longer willing to endure its economic predation or ignore", "who are no longer willing to endure its economic predation or ignore\nits aggression and security threats. Thus, China faces a new era of\nrisks that the Party\u2019s own policies have brought about.\nThis chapter examines some of China\u2019s key responses to its per-\nceptions of intensifying domestic and international risks. It will\nfirst investigate China\u2019s efforts to improve economic resilience in\nits food, energy, and financial infrastructure. It will then examine\nrecent changes in Chinese leaders\u2019 assessment of their environment\nand survey the Party-state\u2019s efforts to enhance political control over\nChina\u2019s institutions and society. Finally, it will assess recent efforts\nto improve the capacity of China\u2019s armed forces and society to rap-\nidly mobilize for a conflict, before considering implications for the\nUnited States.

General Secretary Xi\u2019s speech and accom-\npanying report to the 20th Party Congress in October 2022 struck\na darker tone than the previous one in 2017, emphasizing rising\nthreats and calling on the nation to \u201cbe ready to withstand high\nwinds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms.\u201d 2 Customary lan-\nguage about China\u2019s \u201cperiod of strategic opportunity\u201d and \u201cpeace and\ndevelopment\u201d as \u201cthe theme of the times\u201d was dropped from the po-\nlitical report, which instead stated that strategic opportunities were\nnow concurrent with risks and challenges.* 3 In a speech to the Cen-", "now concurrent with risks and challenges.* 3 In a speech to the Cen-\ntral National Security Commission in May 2023, Xi continued this\nintensified rhetoric, describing the national security environment as\n\u201ccomplex and severe.\u201d 4\nThe language in senior leadership\u2019s speeches has also become\nincreasingly confrontational. In a speech to representatives from\nthe commercial sector during the annual \u201ctwo sessions\u201d in March\n2023, Xi plainly stated that \u201cWestern countries\u2014led by the United\nStates\u2014have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and\nsuppression against us, bringing unprecedentedly severe challenges\nto our country\u2019s development.\u201d \u2020 5 Xi has also increasingly exhorted\n* The concept of the period of strategic opportunity was introduced by Jiang Zemin at the 16th Par-\nty Congress in 2002, characterizing the first two decades of the 21st century as presenting a peaceful\nexternal environment and stable domestic situation that would allow China to concentrate on eco-", "external environment and stable domestic situation that would allow China to concentrate on eco-\nnomic growth and development, building on Deng Xiaoping\u2019s statement that \u201cpeace and development\nare the theme of the times.\u201d Center for Strategic Translation, \u201cPeace and Development are the Theme\nof the Times;\u201d Center for Strategic Translation, \u201cPeriod of Strategic Opportunity.\u201d\n\u2020 The speech was given to delegates of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference\n(CPPCC), an advisory body, from the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the\nChina National Democratic Construction Association, during the March 2023 \u201ctwo sessions,\u201d an-\nnual plenary sessions of the National People\u2019s Congress and of the Chinese People\u2019s Political\nConsultative Conference; Xi also gave two speeches to the NPC and one to representatives of\nthe PLA and People\u2019s Armed Police.

Xi first\nmentioned \u201cextreme scenario thinking\u201d alongside \u201cworst-case sce-\nnario thinking\u201d at the May 2023 meeting of the Central Nation-\nal Security Commission.* 8 The two terms refer to methodologies\nParty cadres can supposedly use to \u201cplan for worst-case scenarios,\nand encourage adopting proactive measures.\u201d 9 According to the tes-\ntimony of Manoj Kewalramani, Chair of the Indo-Pacific Research\nProgramme and China Studies Fellow at the Takshashila Institu-\ntion, \u201cextreme scenario thinking\u201d enables understanding of feasible", "tion, \u201cextreme scenario thinking\u201d enables understanding of feasible\nactions in unpredictable crisis situations by imagining the greatest\nlevel of severity that might occur in a given scenario. In contrast,\n\u201cbottom line thinking\u201d refers to setting minimum standards or red\nlines that cannot be breached, and making preparation to prevent\npredictable challenges.10 Mr. Kewalramani pointed out that extreme\nscenario thinking could be used by Chinese strategists when consid-\nering the repercussions of proactive behavior, which could plausibly\ninclude a Chinese decision to attack Taiwan.11\nComprehensive National Security Concept Underpins\nStronger National Security State\nThe \u201cComprehensive National Security Concept\u201d forms the\nideological basis for the subordination of all aspects of governance\nto national security. First outlined in a 2014 speech by Xi, it ex-\npands the concept of national security beyond traditional military\nthreats and territorial integrity to nontraditional threats to re-", "threats and territorial integrity to nontraditional threats to re-\ngime survival, emphasizing the connection between domestic and\nforeign threats.12 The initial concept laid out 11 types of security:\npolitical, military, territorial, economic, cultural, social, technolog-\nical, information, ecological, resource, and nuclear.13 Additional\ntypes were added over the years, and the concept now encom-\npasses 20 types, including food, finance, overseas interests, space,\ndeep sea, polar regions, biological, artificial intelligence, and data\nsecurity.14 Political security, however, is the most important task\nand is defined as safeguarding the leadership and governing sta-\ntus of the Party.15 Economic growth and the risks created by ex-\ncessive debt and other issues are significant aspects of the con-\ncept because the economy continues to serve as a key source of\nthe CCP\u2019s legitimacy\u2014and therefore its political security.16 While\neconomic and financial security are encompassed by the Com-", "economic and financial security are encompassed by the Com-\nprehensive National Security Concept, the CCP is increasingly\nwilling to accept potential economic costs in order to prioritize\npolitical security.17\n14th NPC,\u201d March 14, 2023; Wang Cong and Tu Lei, \u201cXiconomics in Practice: President Xi Puts\nHigh-Quality Devt Front and Center at Two Sessions,\u201d Global Times, March 14, 2023; Xinhua, \u201cXi\nStresses Enhancing Integrated National Strategies, Strategic Capabilities,\u201d March 8 2023; Xin-\nhua, \u201cXi Calls for Guiding Healthy, High-Quality Development of Private Sector,\u201d March 7, 2023.\n* \u201cBottom-line thinking\u201d (\u5e95\u7ebf\u601d\u7ef4) is sometimes translated as \u201cworst-case scenario thinking.\u201d\n463\nAssessing the Party-State\u2019s Activity: New Measures\nfor Control, Mobilization, and Resilience\nThe CCP has undertaken robust measures over the past decade\nto enhance its control, resilience, and capacity to mobilize resources\nin the economic, political, and military domains.

However, those same actions could also be a response\nto the country\u2019s widespread famines throughout the 20th century\nand energy crises that have affected certain provinces as recently as\n2021.18 Similarly, Chinese efforts to internationalize the RMB and\ndevelop alternative payments systems began as a response to con-\ntractions in global dollar liquidity in the aftermath of the 1997 Asia\nfinancial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis.19 However, the\nsame systems that can ensure Chinese firms and their trading part-\nners have ample access to credit and exchange during a recession\nalso may allow China to insulate its financial sector and external\ntrade from U.S. financial sanctions.\nOne thing is clear: the Chinese economy is more prepared today\nfor a crisis scenario\u2014one catalyzed by confrontation with the United", "for a crisis scenario\u2014one catalyzed by confrontation with the United\nStates or another unpredictable event\u2014than it was two decades ear-\nlier when the country was first constructing its strategic petroleum\nreserves and exploring RMB internationalization.20 Even if Chinese\nmotivations are entirely domestic, the United States can no longer\nrely on intertwined food supply chains, China\u2019s profound dependence\non seaborne oil, and the blocking power of U.S. sanctions to enhance\ndeterrence as strongly as they may have done in the past.\nFood Security in China\nGeneral Secretary Xi has continued China\u2019s historic focus on food\nsecurity by prioritizing efforts to increase domestic production, di-\nversify supply chains, and build stockpiles.

In a 2022 address to the Chi-\nna-Gulf Cooperation Council, Xi emphasized the need for increased\nuse of the RMB in oil and natural gas trading and settlement\nthrough the Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange over\nthe next three to five years.247\nStill, RMB usage remains significantly behind the U.S. dollar in\nglobal commodity markets.

Most countries would\nstill rely on the dollar for transactions not involving China.\nSanctioning China in a Crisis Scenario\nThe United States and its allies have three broad avenues\nthrough which they can impose economic sanctions targeting Chi-\nna\u2019s financial system. They can implement full blocking sanctions\nwhich would prohibit any transactions between U.S. individuals\nand companies and Chinese entities.249 Importantly, this approach\nwould include key parts of the global payments infrastructure,\nincluding clearing and settlement institutions and correspondent\nbank networks, which are formal agreements or relationships be-\ntween banks to provide cross-border payments services for each\nother. Full blocking sanctions would not only prevent transactions\nbetween China and the United States but also disrupt transac-\ntions between China and other countries that rely on U.S. pay-", "tions between China and other countries that rely on U.S. pay-\nments infrastructure. The United States can also impose sover-\neign debt restrictions that would block debt issued by the Chinese\ngovernment, central bank, national wealth fund, and companies\nfrom U.S. markets. Finally, the United States could compel SWIFT\nto impose a ban on Chinese institutions. This would prohibit the\nprovision of the SWIFT financial messaging service to sanctioned\nChinese entities. Full blocking sanctions and a SWIFT ban would\nhave the biggest impact on the Chinese economy.* 250\nThe disruptions to global supply chains caused by completely\ncutting off the world\u2019s largest exporter from access to U.S. dollar\nfinancing, however, would likely generate political opposition in\nthe United States and globally.\u2020 A 2024 analysis from Rhodium\n* In addition to these options, the United States could freeze a large share of China\u2019s $3.22", "* In addition to these options, the United States could freeze a large share of China\u2019s $3.22\ntrillion in foreign exchange reserves. However, a 2024 study from Rhodium Group and the At-\nlantic Council argues this would neither be credible nor desirable for the United States. The\nprimary effect would be to limit China\u2019s capacity to defend its currency. Without Chinese support\nthe RMB would experience a sharp depreciation and make China\u2019s exports more competitive in\nglobal markets. Logan Wright et al., \u201cRetaliation and Resilience Chinese Economic Statecraft in\na Taiwan Crisis,\u201d Atlantic Council, April 1, 2024, 33.\n\u2020 U.S. and allied sanctions against Russia demonstrate how political resistance in both the\nsanction imposing countries and other global economies can block certain actions. While sanc-\ntions aim to cause the most disruption to the targeted country, they may have unintended side\neffects. For example, the United States and EU scaled back plans to ban the provision of financial", "effects. For example, the United States and EU scaled back plans to ban the provision of financial\nservices to companies transporting Russian oil for fear that fully crippling Russian oil exports\nwould cause a surge in the global price of oil and a global recession. Lutz Kilian and David\n488\nSanctioning China in a Crisis Scenario\u2014Continued\nGroup and the Atlantic Council suggests that as a result, China\nbelieves complete restrictions on the country\u2019s financing channels\nare implausible.251 While the United States would sanction some\ninstitutions, China could respond by reallocating critical trade\nand financial transactions with willing partners through very\nlarge or very small financial institutions.252 China can designate\na series of small, structurally insignificant financial institutions\nto conduct its trade, knowing they will be sanctioned. China\u2019s use\nof the Bank of Kunlun to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran il-\nlustrate this. China designated this small, state-owned bank to", "lustrate this. China designated this small, state-owned bank to\ncontinue to finance payments to Iran using the RMB. China\u2019s use\nof the Bank of Kunlun ensured it could continue to trade with the\nsanctioned country without risking the impact of U.S. sanctions\non more important actors in its financial sector.* 253 Alternatively,\nChina could look to its largest financial institutions. Chinese offi-\ncials may be calculating that the possibility of substantial disrup-\ntions in permitted trade and dislocations in global supply chains\ncould be threatening enough to deter the imposition of sanctions\nand secondary sanctions.254\nChina could also rely on its alternative payments infrastruc-\nture to circumvent financial sanctions or secondary sanctions\nthat are designed to prevent non-U.S. entities from transacting\nwith countries subject to U.S. sanctions.255 China could route\nenergy imports and source critical commodities and components", "energy imports and source critical commodities and components\nvia countries that are unlikely to cooperate with U.S. sanctions.\nTo do so, they would use the RMB as a payment currency.256\nDr. Liu argues this could require minimal adjustment time.257\nMany commodity exporters to China already receive some RMB\nfor their current transactions.258 Still, sanctions\u2014including freez-\ning China\u2019s official dollar reserves\u2014would make dollars in Chi-\nna scarce, driving down the value of the RMB exchange rate.\nA weaker exchange rate would make goods imports into China\nmore expensive, distort China\u2019s export trade, and generate sub-\nstantial financial stress for Chinese companies operating in glob-\nal markets.259 Secondary sanctions would still cause disruptions\nto Chinese trade, but, because these would be perceived by third\ncountries as a significant escalation by the G7, the United States\nwould face broader constraints on such sanctions.260", "would face broader constraints on such sanctions.260\nIn both scenarios, the limiting factor jeopardizing China\u2019s abil-\nity to evade sanctions will not be its financial infrastructure\u2014\nChina can always admit new institutions into CIPS or, once live,\ncentral banks into its wholesale CBDC. The functionality of these\nnetworks will be restricted by the willingness of third countries\nto use them.

For example, Dr.\nLiu points out that China\u2019s global commodity suppliers depend\non the dollar-based system to price and trade their commodity\nexports.262 Their banks, as well as most of China\u2019s other trading\npartners, remain reliant on SWIFT and CHIPS for their domestic\nbanking system as well as their international payments settle-\nments.

Official\nrhetoric aimed at Taiwan and the United States has become con-\nsiderably more negative and intense, but it has not taken on the\nescalatory tone that preceded China\u2019s conflicts with its neighbors\nin past decades, and it appears\u2014for now\u2014to be leaving the door\nopen for dialogue and delay. That said, observers of China should\nnot rely wholly on indicators from past conflicts, as China\u2019s political\nenvironment and culture has evolved and official rhetoric is unlikely\nto exactly match that seen in the Mao era.

These efforts undoubtedly assist\nGeneral Secretary Xi in his ongoing consolidation of power over Chi-\nna but also create a system that is more agile in the face of external\nthreats and useful for sustaining a military conflict.265\nCCP Rhetoric Intensifies but Falls Short of What Experts\nExpect in Wartime\nChina\u2019s rhetoric toward the United States and Taiwan appears\nto have intensified, although it has not yet taken on the harsh\ntone and phrasing that preceded China\u2019s prior conflicts and does\nnot foreclose the possibility of communication. In their testimony to\nthe Commission, both Mr. Kewalramani and Timothy Heath, senior\ninternational defense researcher at the RAND Corporation, stated\nthey would expect to see top Chinese leaders demonize the United", "they would expect to see top Chinese leaders demonize the United\nStates and Taiwan and assert that all peaceful means of resolving\nthe dispute had been exhausted if China were imminently prepar-\ning for conflict.266 During the 1950s and 1960s, Mao directly exco-\n490\nriated the United States in the harshest terms and called for mass\nsacrifice amid his country\u2019s proxy conflict with the United States\nin Korea.267 Prior to the Sino-Indian border war in the 1960s and\nChina\u2019s attack on Vietnam in 1979, Chinese leaders and state media\nsteadily escalated rhetorical attacks on their enemies, transitioning\nfrom threats to declarations that they would punish them or teach\nthem a lesson.268\nThe CCP\u2019s rhetoric today exhibits some of these escalatory aspects\nbut not others. For example, CCP officials have arguably already de-\nmonized Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, as when Foreign Minister\nand Director of the Central Committee\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commis-", "and Director of the Central Committee\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commis-\nsion Wang Yi called him a traitor to the nation and his ancestors\nand warned that all \u201c \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 separatists\u201d would be\n\u201cnailed to the pillar of shame in history.\u201d 269 At the same time, se-\nnior Chinese leaders are typically oblique in their condemnations\nof the United States, with Xi mostly opting to refer indirectly to\n\u201ccertain countries\u201d or \u201cWestern countries\u201d when discussing threats\nof containment.* 270 There are some Chinese state media-sponsored\n\u201cdocumentaries\u201d that paint the United States as a warmonger and\na handful of recent films that depict conflict between the United\nStates and China, but as Dr. Heath points out, there is far less\nmedia demonizing the United States than was the case in Maoist\ntimes.271 Most importantly, the CCP continues to signal an openness\nto dialogue with the opposition party in Taiwan and to emphasize\nthat Taiwan separatists are only a tiny minority of the popula-", "that Taiwan separatists are only a tiny minority of the popula-\ntion.272 In these respects, the CCP\u2019s contemporary rhetoric is clearly\nmilder than that it employed in the runup to clashes with India in\nthe 1960s and Vietnam in the 1970s.\nBuilding Out the National Security Apparatus under Party\nControl\nThe CCP has taken steps to expand the power and refine the\nworkings of its national security apparatus, framing these measures\nas elements of a \u201cnew security pattern.\u201d 273 These include creating\na commission to coordinate national security policy, increasing the\nnumber of personnel with security experience in high-ranking posi-\ntions, passing a raft of new laws relating to national security, and\ntightening the vise on Party cadres perceived as undisciplined or\ncorrupt.\nXi-Led Commission Centralizes National Security Policy\nA critical institution in the CCP\u2019s national security apparatus is\nthe Central National Security Commission (CNSC), which now plays", "the Central National Security Commission (CNSC), which now plays\na prominent role in coordinating national security decision-mak-\ning.\u2020 274 The CNSC is a CCP Central Committee body mandated to\n* A notable exception was Xi\u2019s choice to explicitly name the United States during his comments\nat the \u201ctwo sessions\u201d in March 2023.

After the Taiwan Strait\nmissile crisis, the Party-state codified its civil air defense policies into law in the 1997 Civil\nAir Defense Law, mandating that all civilian buildings could serve as air raid shelters if they\nfit appropriate size specifications.

For example, Chi-\nna\u2019s defense mobilization system can be used to respond to natural\ndisasters or to call up troops. Aside from enhancing readiness for\narmed conflict, activities discussed in this chapter can also help to\nprepare China for a long-term strategic competition with the United\nStates and allies and to insulate itself from \u201cde-globalization\u201d and\n\u201cde-risking\u201d efforts and shocks to the global economy.\nSome have argued that the actions identified in this chapter in-\ndicate China\u2019s leadership has concluded that a conflict is inevita-\nble and is preparing for a war or major hostilities against Taiwan\nor the United States to commence in the near future.486 Many of\nthe activities described above could accelerate China\u2019s ability to\nmobilize its military, civilian resources, and the public should its", "mobilize its military, civilian resources, and the public should its\nleaders choose hostile action. U.S. military and intelligence officials\nhave stated that Xi has instructed the PLA to be capable of taking\nTaiwan by 2027, although they have also said there is no evidence\nChina\u2019s leadership has made a decision to attack Taiwan.487 Other\nobservers argue that this target date is intended to give energy and\nfocus to reforms and modernization efforts rather than on setting a\ntimeline for war.488 Nevertheless, Xi has made clear that a central\n514\naspect of his policy of \u201cnational rejuvenation\u201d is China\u2019s complete\n\u201creunification\u201d with Taiwan.489 The PLA\u2019s practice of strategic de-\nception and its increased activity around Taiwan further complicate\nattempts to discern whether or not China is actively preparing for\nan imminent war.\nIf the political, economic, and military activities covered in this\nchapter were part of an imminent march to war, some experts ar-", "chapter were part of an imminent march to war, some experts ar-\ngue that one would expect to see additional, unambiguous indica-\ntors and activities. For example, Chinese military training patterns\nwould shift, with a noticeable uptick in defense mobilization training\nefforts such as amphibious exercises involving civilian shipping.490\nChina\u2019s emergency management system may launch education cam-\npaigns and hold trainings on how to evacuate, take shelter, and ad-\nminister first aid, particularly in Chinese provinces closest to the\nanticipated conflict area.491 There would probably be a significant\nupward departure from the trailing three-year and five-year average\naboveground crude oil storage utilization rates.

Any\njudgment about the significance of the activities described in this\nchapter should be tempered by the fact that motives are not al-\nways\u2014or even often\u2014singular, particularly as here when the ob-\nserved activities are so varied that numerous disparate policy ra-\ntionales are likely involved.

China\u2019s aggressive control,\nresilience, and mobilization activities have made it more prepared\nto engage in a conflict over Taiwan or elsewhere in Asia and more\ncapable of conducting hostilities today than it was even a few years\nago. Furthermore, many of China\u2019s recent policies, combined with\ntightened controls on access to information, could reduce the visibili-\nty of actions that might be signals of preparations for imminent war.\nFinally, these activities have reduced the deterrent effect of various\nnonmilitary policies and external constraints on China.

As a result, U.S. forces\nand bases in the region would face a significant threat from the\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) in any regional contingency involv-\ning treaty allies and/or security partners, and the outcome of any\nsuch conflict is far from certain. In addition, U.S. allies Japan, the\nPhilippines, and Australia perceive China\u2019s military buildup and\naggressive actions as a growing threat to their national security\nand are deepening defense collaboration with the United States. As\nthe United States continues to enhance its capacity to respond to\nChinese aggression, it must navigate both potential differences with", "Chinese aggression, it must navigate both potential differences with\nallies about the parameters of cooperation during a conflict as well\nas questions about how to best adapt its force posture, capabilities,\nand defense industrial base.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 The PLA plans to counter military action by the United States\nand potentially U.S. allies in the event of a regional conflict.\nSince at least the early 2000s, China\u2019s leadership has viewed\nthe U.S. military\u2019s presence and alliance activities in the In-\ndo-Pacific as threatening, and it continues to express concern\nabout new developments that combine deepening allied coop-\neration with an expanded U.S. military footprint in the region.\n\u2022 China\u2019s assertion that it will militarily defend its disputed ter-\nritorial and maritime claims threatens U.S. allies and security\npartners in the Indo-Pacific. Should China\u2019s leadership decide to\nuse force to enforce its claims in the South or East China Seas", "use force to enforce its claims in the South or East China Seas\nor with regard to Taiwan, this aggression could trigger U.S. de-\nfense commitments.\n\u2022 The PLA continues to improve the quality and quantity of mil-\nitary capabilities needed to counter U.S. military action in the\nevent of a conflict, including a large arsenal of ballistic and\ncruise missiles, air defense systems, advanced fighter jets, mar-\nitime forces, and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities.\n\u2022 The PLA has also developed a redundant and resilient architecture\nfor Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,\nSurveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) to protect its own sys-\ntems from attack, and it increasingly has the capability to disrupt\nor paralyze an adversary\u2019s C4ISR system. China\u2019s advancements\n(540)\n541\nin counter-C4ISR capabilities such as directed energy weapons and\nanti-satellite technologies may threaten the United States\u2019 ability\nto access its own C4ISR networks for reconnaissance, targeting,", "to access its own C4ISR networks for reconnaissance, targeting,\nand other functions in peacetime or wartime.\n\u2022 Despite improvements to a broad suite of capabilities, the PLA\nstill faces challenges in logistics and sustainment. The PLA\u2019s\nmaintenance system may struggle to quickly repair and resup-\nply its advanced platforms and weapons systems under harsh\nbattlefield conditions, impacting the PLA\u2019s ability to project and\nsustain combat power.\n\u2022 Chinese military experts perceive that U.S. and allied militar-\nies are adapting to the PLA\u2019s improved capabilities and force\nposture. They observe that the United States and its allies\nare strengthening their missile defense capabilities while also\nworking to improve their ability to strike China\u2019s forces. They\nalso note that new operational concepts emphasizing geograph-\nic dispersion and joint integration across warfighting domains\ncould also contribute to U.S. and allied forces\u2019 survivability.", "could also contribute to U.S. and allied forces\u2019 survivability.\n\u2022 U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific are adjusting their defense pol-\nicies in response to Beijing\u2019s aggressive military posture and\nactivities. Japanese leaders are concerned about a possible re-\ngional conflict and therefore seek to enhance Japan\u2019s military\ncapabilities and interoperability with the United States. The\ncurrent government of the Philippines views cooperation with\nthe United States and other partners as core elements of its\nresponse to China\u2019s military and gray zone threats in the South\nChina Sea and its own military modernization efforts. Australia\nseeks to deepen security cooperation with the United States,\nits chief defense partner, while re-posturing its own military\nfor the possibility of great power conflict. Nevertheless, allies\u2019\ninterest in working with the United States to address threats\nfrom the PLA does not necessarily imply a commitment to allow", "from the PLA does not necessarily imply a commitment to allow\nU.S. military access to their bases during a conflict or guarantee\nthe participation of allied military forces.\nRecommendations\nThe Commission recommends:\n\u2022 Congress direct the U.S. Department of Defense to produce\nwithin 60 days a classified net assessment report on current\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) Command, Control, Communi-\ncations, Computers Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnais-\nsance (C4ISR) capabilities and PLA electronic warfare (EW) ca-\npabilities (including electronic attack and electronic protection\ncapabilities). The report should examine U.S. counter-C4ISR\nand counter-EW capabilities, assess the resiliency of U.S. capa-\nbilities, identify counter-C4ISR and counter-EW gaps, and pro-\nvide a menu of procurement options to close the gaps.

The agreement strengthens the legal frame-\nwork and establishes regular procedures for cooperative military activities, including relaxing\nimmigration control for military personnel and simplifying procedures for transporting weapons", "immigration control for military personnel and simplifying procedures for transporting weapons\nand ammunition. The first application of the agreement later in 2023 saw Japan deploy two F-35\naircraft to Australia\u2014the first-ever overseas deployment of F-35s by Japan\u2014in an exercise that\nis likely to pave the way for greater interoperability in the future.

China has sustained a high level of mili-\ntary, diplomatic, and economic pressure toward the ruling Democrat-", "tary, diplomatic, and economic pressure toward the ruling Democrat-\nic Progressive Party (DPP) of Taiwan, timing actions around events\nboth to undermine DPP leadership and to extend olive branches to\nopposition figures who signal support for closer cross-Strait rela-\ntions. The CCP has expanded its toolkit of tactics for intimidating\nTaiwan, including greater usage of the China Coast Guard (CCG)\naround the outlying islands, new guidelines for punishing \u201csep-\naratists,\u201d and heightened harassment of Taiwan travelers to the\nMainland. Taiwan has enhanced its defensive capacity through U.S.\nassistance and its own internal reforms, with an increased focus\non military and societal resiliency. Taiwan\u2019s military continues to\ntake notable steps to develop, manufacture, and adopt asymmetric\nsystems and improve training for conscripts and reservists, but do-\nmestic factors and China\u2019s near-daily coercion remain challenges to\nthis progress. Despite China\u2019s aggressive posture, Taiwan\u2019s vibrant", "this progress. Despite China\u2019s aggressive posture, Taiwan\u2019s vibrant\nand advanced economy has performed strongly this year, thanks to\nsubstantial global demand for its high-value exports integral to ar-\ntificial intelligence (AI) and technology supply chains. U.S.-Taiwan\nrelations remain constructive and robust, with the United States\ncontinuing to signal and provide steadfast support for Taiwan in a\nvariety of ways.\nKey Findings\n\u2022 Lai\u2019s election to the presidency signals broad support for his\npolicies among Taiwan\u2019s populace; however, the DPP\u2019s loss-\nes in Taiwan\u2019s legislature may restrain the Lai Administra-\ntion\u2019s agenda. Beijing reacted to Taiwan exercising its right\nto self-governance with immediate, extreme rhetoric as well\nas policy adjustments aimed at intimidating Taiwan. China\nescalated its indirect threats against not only Taiwan\u2019s lead-\nership but also its international supporters by defining \u201csep-\naratism\u201d in law as a crime punishable by death in certain\ncircumstances.", "aratism\u201d in law as a crime punishable by death in certain\ncircumstances.\n(611)\n612\n\u2022 China has refused to communicate directly with the new DPP\npresident and has chosen to intensify its political coercion ef-\nforts against Taiwan, suggesting that the frigid relationship be-\ntween the DPP Administration and the Mainland will persist.\nRather, the CCP has shown that it would prefer to go around\nthe Lai Administration by interacting with opposition parties\nand interfering in Taiwan\u2019s political system.\n\u2022 China has intensified its military coercion around Taiwan, aim-\ning to gain operational experience, degrade the Taiwan military\u2019s\nreadiness, and intimidate the island\u2019s population while routiniz-\ning its increased presence. The People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA)\nlaunched its second named military exercise around Taiwan\nimmediately after Lai\u2019s inauguration in May, as well as a fol-\nlow-on exercise in October, and continued to violate the island\u2019s", "low-on exercise in October, and continued to violate the island\u2019s\nair defense identification zone (ADIZ) on a near-daily basis with\nconventional aircraft, drones, and balloons.\n\u2022 Beijing has also expanded its use of so-called \u201cgray zone\u201d tac-\ntics\u2014blurring the line between military and non-military ac-\ntions\u2014against Taiwan in the maritime and air domains under\nthe guise of law enforcement and administrative activity in an\nattempt to propagate its claim that Taiwan and the Taiwan\nStrait are its territory. The CCG\u2019s robust role in the May PLA\nexercise was novel and suggested that the CCG could augment\nfuture PLA operations against Taiwan. The reported presence of\nCCG ships around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands outside the context\nof a PLA exercise is similarly concerning, laying the groundwork\nfor a more persistent presence and representing an attempt to\nextend \u201clawfare\u201d to its gray zone activities. China\u2019s unilateral\nmodifications of civilian flight paths in the Taiwan Strait also", "modifications of civilian flight paths in the Taiwan Strait also\nabrogated a prior commitment made in 2015 to allay Taiwan\u2019s\nsecurity concerns, increasing the risk of an air accident and fur-\nthering its efforts to nullify the median line.\n\u2022 Taiwan continues to shore up its remaining diplomatic partners\nin the face of Chinese pressure to break ties while deepening its\nunofficial relationships with major countries in North America,\nEurope, and Asia. Using various points of leverage and influ-\nence, Beijing has engaged in an effort to get other countries\nto endorse its false claim that the 1971 UN General Assembly\n(UNGA) Resolution 2758 recognizes China\u2019s sovereignty over\nTaiwan as a matter of international law and to make state-\nments supportive of China\u2019s unification goals for Taiwan.\n\u2022 Taiwan\u2019s economy performed strongly in 2024, with AI-fueled\ndemand for leading-edge chips and other high-tech manufac-\ntured products bringing about a surge in exports and a runup", "tured products bringing about a surge in exports and a runup\nin the domestic stock index. This growth came as cross-Strait\ntrade tensions heightened in the form of China\u2019s Ministry of\nFinance revoking preferential tariff exemptions on 134 products\nTaiwan exports to the Mainland in a move announced less than\ntwo weeks after Lai\u2019s inauguration.\n\u2022 Approved outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) from Tai-\nwan into the Mainland fell 39.8 percent year-over-year in 2023\n613\nto its lowest level in over 20 years. Meanwhile, approved FDI\nfrom Taiwan into the United States surged 791 percent in the\nsame time period to $9.7 billion, a record high. In April 2024,\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company announced it\nwould expand its planned investment in the United States over\n60 percent to $65 billion after receiving a $6.6 billion federal\ngrant as part of the CHIPS and Science Act.\nRecommendations\nThe Commission recommends:\n\u2022 Congress amend the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 to include", "The Commission recommends:\n\u2022 Congress amend the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 to include\nTaiwan on the list of \u201cNATO Plus\u201d recipients.\n\u2022 Congress create a \u201cTaiwan Allies Fund\u201d that would provide\nforeign assistance only to countries that have an official diplo-\nmatic relationship with Taiwan. No country could receive more\nthan 15 percent of the appropriated funding each year. Coun-\ntries that no longer have a diplomatic relationship with Taiwan\nwould immediately be ineligible for this funding.\nIntroduction\nTaiwan\u2019s new president, Lai Ching-te, was inaugurated on May\n20, 2024, with Beijing refusing to engage directly and actively wag-\ning a political warfare campaign designed to discredit the new ad-\nministration.1 Three days after the inauguration, China conducted\na military exercise, Operation Joint Sword 2024A, that simulated\nsurrounding Taiwan in preparation for an invasion or blockade, as\nit has done every year since 2022. Beijing also stepped up economic", "it has done every year since 2022. Beijing also stepped up economic\ncoercion in the weeks following Lai\u2019s inauguration by revoking pref-\nerential trade tariffs on over 100 products, rolling back decades-old\ncross-Strait trade arrangements.2 Despite high tensions, Taiwan\u2019s\neconomy was resurgent in 2024, posting strong economic growth\nfigures fueled by booming demand for cutting-edge semiconductors\nused to train AI.3 This chapter analyzes developments in Taiwan\u2019s\npolitics, security, and economy between late 2023 and late 2024. It\nis based on the Commission\u2019s consultation with experts, open source\nresearch, and fact-finding travel.\nCross-Strait Political Relations Remain Dismal as\nTaiwan Elects New DPP Government\nAt the beginning of 2024, Taiwan\u2019s voters went to the polls to\nchoose a new president from among three political parties and elect-\ned then Vice President Lai Ching-te of the DPP to be Taiwan\u2019s next\nleader. Despite Lai\u2019s success in the presidential election, the DPP", "leader. Despite Lai\u2019s success in the presidential election, the DPP\nlost its majority in Taiwan\u2019s legislature, leaving the island with a di-\nvided government in which the DPP must work with the opposition\nparties to enact Lai\u2019s legislative agenda.4 Beijing responded to Lai\u2019s\nelection with protests, as it had expressed extreme antipathy to-\nward his candidacy during the run-up to the election and waged an\nintense disinformation campaign to persuade Taiwan\u2019s voters that\nelecting Lai would lead to war.5 In the months afterward, Beijing\nhas doubled down on its coercive rhetoric, interference activities,\nand refusal to engage constructively with the DPP-led government\n614\nwhile continuing to host and talk with Taiwan\u2019s opposition parties.6\nLai has pledged to continue the previous Tsai Administration\u2019s poli-\ncies and expressed a desire to engage constructively with the Main-\nland while protecting Taiwan\u2019s democracy and autonomy.7 Taiwan\u2019s", "land while protecting Taiwan\u2019s democracy and autonomy.7 Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment and civil society continue to combat the CCP\u2019s attempts\nto subvert the elected government, polarize the public, and pollute\nthe media environment with false narratives.8\nChinese Influence Campaigns Fail to Sway\nTaiwan\u2019s Election\nChinese officials sought to dissuade Taiwan voters from elect-\ning Lai by denouncing him with harsh official rhetoric and likely\ndirecting robust influence and disinformation campaigns. These\nefforts ultimately failed to alter the outcome. According to Taiwan\nsecurity officials, senior Chinese leaders held a meeting in early\nDecember 2023 to coordinate efforts to sway the 2024 elections in\nTaiwan.9 The meeting, which was led by fourth-ranked Politburo\nStanding Committee member Wang Huning, reportedly discussed\nthe roles of various agencies in influencing Taiwan\u2019s election.10\nThe meeting resulted in a plan that the CCP\u2019s Propaganda De-", "The meeting resulted in a plan that the CCP\u2019s Propaganda De-\npartment and a PLA psychological warfare unit would conduct in-\nfluence campaigns through news outlets and social media, while\nthe Taiwan Affairs Office and United Front Work Department\nwould engage with Taiwan politicians and provide Taiwan citi-\nzens living in the Mainland with discounted airline tickets to fly\nhome to vote.11 During Taiwan\u2019s presidential campaign, China\u2019s\nTaiwan Affairs Office warned voters that they faced a choice be-\ntween war and peace, implying that Lai\u2019s election could provoke\na war.12 In the aftermath of a debate among Taiwan presidential\ncandidates in late December 2023, China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office\nspokesperson Chen Binhua asserted that Lai had \u201cexposed his\ntrue face as a stubborn \u2018worker for Taiwan independence\u2019 and\ndestroyer of peace across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d continuing a trend\nin Chinese official statements of mischaracterizing Lai\u2019s positions", "in Chinese official statements of mischaracterizing Lai\u2019s positions\nand describing him as a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d and \u201cseparatist.\u201d 13\nU.S. cybersecurity firms also documented a notable uptick in\nChinese state-sponsored disinformation campaigns targeting\nTaiwan\u2019s media environment, some of which involve the use of\nAI-generated content. According to a report by Microsoft Threat\nIntelligence, Chinese state-linked cyber actors conducted an in-\nfluence campaign to dissuade Taiwan\u2019s voters from choosing Lai,\nconstituting what Microsoft says is the first time it has ever ob-\nserved nation-state actors using AI in an attempt to influence\na foreign election.14 Microsoft highlights cyber actors such as\nStorm-1376, which it says used AI to generate memes spread-\ning fake news, falsify images, and create deepfakes of presiden-\ntial candidates.* 15 Storm-1376\u2019s online disinformation campaign\n* Storm-1376 (also known as \u201cDragonbridge\u201d or \u201cSpamouflage\u201d) also targeted other actors in", "* Storm-1376 (also known as \u201cDragonbridge\u201d or \u201cSpamouflage\u201d) also targeted other actors in\nTaiwan\u2019s political scene and election. For example, it reportedly created and amplified a defam-\natory video series about then President Tsai using AI-generated news anchors and ByteDance\u2019s\nCapCut video editing app. On the presidential election day in January, Storm-1376 posted likely\nAI-generated audio clips of Foxconn owner Terry Gou, formerly an independent candidate in the\npresidential race. The audio manipulates Mr. Gou\u2019s voice to make it sound as though he is en-\ndorsing Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Hou You-yi, even though he never formally endorsed any\n615\nChinese Influence Campaigns Fail to Sway\nTaiwan\u2019s Election\u2014Continued\nincluded promotion of AI-generated memes suggesting Lai was\ncorrupt and an AI-generated news anchor who delivered a report\ncontaining false information about Lai.16 Blackbird.AI, a cyber\nthreat intelligence firm, also released a report that identifies sev-", "threat intelligence firm, also released a report that identifies sev-\neral narratives that China-linked influence actors attempted to\nperpetuate during the election cycle.17 These include narratives\nthat Taiwan\u2019s public is anti-DPP and pro-PLA, that only China\ncan stop the United States from turning Taiwan into a warzone,\nand that Taiwan\u2019s independence would harm stability in Asia.18\nTaiwan\u2019s government and civil society have responded vigor-\nously to China\u2019s cognitive warfare campaign. In February 2024,\nTaiwan prosecutors charged two Taiwan citizens for allegedly\nfabricating and disseminating bogus opinion polls at the direc-\ntion of the CCP in an attempt to influence the election, with one\nindividual fabricating surveys and another publishing those sur-\nveys via a media company established in Taiwan after a visit to\nthe Mainland.19 Nonprofits such as the Information Environment\nResearch Center (originally Information Operations Research", "Research Center (originally Information Operations Research\nGroup) and Doublethink Lab continue to educate Taiwan\u2019s pub-\nlic on media literacy and expose influence operations, while the\ngrassroots civic group Cofacts operates an online fact-checking\nchatbot.20 Taiwan\u2019s government has also established a dedicated\nelection-related fake news task force reportedly able to provide\nfactual clarification within four hours of detection, releasing re-\nsponses on multiple internet platforms.21\nLai Triumphs Electorally and Beijing Responds with Anger\nand Coercion\nLai\u2019s election as Taiwan\u2019s president represents the first time any\nof Taiwan\u2019s political parties has won a third consecutive presidential\nterm and reflects public support for a leader who would stand up\nto Beijing\u2019s coercion.22 Lai defeated his opponents Hou You-yi, the\nmayor of New Taipei who ran as the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate,\nand Ko Wen-je, the former mayor of Taipei who ran as the Taiwan", "and Ko Wen-je, the former mayor of Taipei who ran as the Taiwan\nPeople\u2019s Party (TPP) candidate.* 23 The candidates presented differ-\ning visions for cross-Strait relations on the campaign trail: while Lai\nmaintained that negotiations with Beijing should only proceed if the\ntwo sides engage as equals and if the status quo of Taiwan\u2019s de facto\nautonomy is maintained, Hou and Ko both struck more conciliatory\nnotes, favoring the reestablishment of cross-Strait dialogue without\npreconditions and a relationship based on shared cultural values\nand pragmatism, respectively.24 Lai won with over 40 percent of\nthe vote in Taiwan\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system, though he\npresidential candidate in the race.

Hong Kong has experienced a serious erosion in its au-\ntonomy from the Mainland, although the manifestation of this ero-\nsion to date has been far more prominent in civil rights compared\nwith the business environment.

The continued implementation of the mainland Na-\ntional Security Law (NSL) and the imposition of the Article 23 Or-\ndinance, which has already been invoked to make new arrests, have\ndiminished the former distinctiveness of Hong Kong.

Beijing\u2019s heavy-handed control over\nthe city has led many Hong Kongers, including activists, families,\nand business professionals, to leave. Consequently, Hong Kong\u2019s\nstatus as an international business hub has deteriorated, and its\neconomy has lost significant ground since the passage of the NSL\nin 2020. The seven million residents of Hong Kong continue to enjoy\ngreater freedoms than those living on the Mainland\u2014including a\nfreely convertible currency and comparatively uncensored internet\nand media\u2014but only so far as they refrain from violating the CCP\u2019s\nbroad and opaque conceptions of political dissent.

At the same\ntime, Hong Kong\u2019s broader economy faces headwinds, including slow\neconomic growth and a sluggish market, while a steady flight of\nmultinational firms scale back their operations or leave the city\naltogether.

representative offices, outposts found-\ned before China\u2019s takeover of Hong Kong, promote the goals of the\nMainland and the Beijing-backed Hong Kong government abroad.337\nCentral to these efforts are the Hong Kong Economics and Trade\nOffices (HKETOs), identified by the Hong Kong Democracy Council\n(HKDC), a Washington, DC-based activist group, as a pivotal player\nin influencing U.S. policy toward Hong Kong and China through\nan extensive lobbying campaign.338 Importantly, the HKETOs are\nnot official diplomatic outposts of the Chinese government.339 The\nHKETOs were established before the handover of Hong Kong to\nChina and granted immunities and diplomatic protections in June\n1997, a time when political agreements between the UK and Chi-\nna guaranteed that the HKETOs and broader Hong Kong interest", "na guaranteed that the HKETOs and broader Hong Kong interest\ngroups would maintain autonomy from the Chinese government\u2019s\ngoals.340 The HKETOs have conducted

recommended that Congress, pursuant to the Hong Kong Human\nRights and Democracy Act, amend the International Organization Immunities Act to remove\nHong Kong Economic and Trade Offices as a covered organization, thereby eliminating diplomatic\nprivileges enjoyed by such offices and their employees in the United States. This amendment\n715\ntions of the HKETOs have further faced scrutiny globally, including\nin the UK, where a staffer of the London HKETO was arrested for\nallegedly violating the UK National Security Act and assisting for-\neign intelligence services between December 2023 and May 2024.342", "eign intelligence services between December 2023 and May 2024.342\nThe HKETO allegedly made bank payments from HKETO accounts\nto individuals to help track Hong Kong activists who are living in\nthe UK.343 In Germany, a former employee of the local chapter of\nthe Hong Kong Trade Development Council, a separate Hong Kong\ntrade promotion body, was also arrested and accused of carrying out\nindustrial espionage for Chinese intelligence services.344\nImplications for the United States\nUnder Beijing\u2019s authoritarian control, the freedoms of press,\nspeech, and assembly that differentiated Hong Kong from mainland\ncities are being eroded. Robust enforcement of the National Securi-\nty Law and the promulgation of the new Article 23 Ordinance are\nintended to coerce the public, instill uncertainty and fear, and cre-\nate an environment of self-censorship, which serves as a form of\nlawfare. Local and foreign tourists, students, and residents in Hong", "lawfare. Local and foreign tourists, students, and residents in Hong\nKong can no longer be certain that their freedoms and rights will be\nupheld by Hong Kong\u2019s legal system or law enforcement.\nThe extraterritorial application of Hong Kong\u2019s national security\nlaws also stands to threaten dissidents, naturalized citizens living\nabroad, and other foreigners who sympathize with Hong Kong, in-\ncluding those in the United States. These individuals face harass-\nment and coercion despite residing in open democracies. Specifically,\nthe Article 23 Ordinance targets activists overseas by denying them\naccess to their financial assets and allowing for the revocation of\npassports and professional licenses, among other things. The Ar-\nticle 23 Ordinance\u2019s new offense of \u201cexternal interference,\u201d paired\nwith the threat of extreme sentencing, also intends to punish Hong\nKongers and dissidents abroad for their interactions with foreign-\ners. The Hong Kong government also targets the families of Hong", "ers. The Hong Kong government also targets the families of Hong\nKong dissidents who still reside in the city. This relational repres-\nsion, along with the transnational repression of Hong Kongers over-\nseas, will continue to worsen as the Article 23 Ordinance is enforced,\nand it creates a potential legal conflict between the United States\nand Hong Kong.\nAmid the atmosphere of oppression created under the Article 23\nOrdinance and Beijing\u2019s sustained crackdown, firms operating in\nHong Kong face an increasingly restrictive business environment\nthat is reflective of conditions on the Mainland. This includes the\npossibility of restrictions on research and due diligence and the\nlooming threat that standard business operations by foreign firms\nin Hong Kong will risk accusations of collaboration with \u201cexternal\ncould be reversed under one of the following conditions: China negotiates an agreement with the", "could be reversed under one of the following conditions: China negotiates an agreement with the\nUnited States to have Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices considered an official part of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s mission to the United States and subject to the same requirements;\nor China alters its treatment of Hong Kong to allow for sufficient autonomy and abides by \u201cone\ncountry, two systems,\u201d as enumerated by the Hong Kong Policy Act. In September 2024, the U.S.\nHouse of Representatives passed the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO) Certifica-\ntion Act, which would allow the U.S. president to remove HKETO privileges if Hong Kong does\nnot maintain a significant degree of autonomy from China. Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office\n(HKETO) Certification Act, H.R.1103, February 17, 2023; U.S.-China Economic and Security Re-\nview Commission, 2022 Annual Report to Congress, November 2022, 735\u2013736.\n716\nforces,\u201d involve \u201cstate secrets,\u201d or otherwise violate the Article 23", "716\nforces,\u201d involve \u201cstate secrets,\u201d or otherwise violate the Article 23\nOrdinance and the NSL. Even if the Hong Kong government does\nnot explicitly punish fact-based reporting of Hong Kong\u2019s economic\nconditions seen as \u201charmful\u201d to China, self-censorship and a lack\nof transparency among auditors, press, firms, and other industry\nparticipants pose risks to investors. These risks are compounded by\nHong Kong\u2019s increasingly apparent role as a regional hub for sanc-\ntions and export control evasion. Meanwhile, Hong Kong continues\nto see its international status dwindle, with the city slipping as a\nshipping hub and its markets increasingly dominated by mainland\nrather than international firms. As the city continues to draw closer\nto its mainland neighbors both politically and economically, it re-\nmains unclear how much distinctiveness and autonomy Hong Kong\ncan truly maintain.\n717\nENDNOTES FOR CHAPTER 10\n1.

AGI is generally defined as systems\nthat are as good as or better than human capabilities across\nall cognitive domains and would surpass the sharpest human\nminds at every task.

Congress consider legislation to:\n\u2022 Require prior approval and ongoing oversight of Chinese in-\nvolvement in biotechnology companies engaged in operations\nin the United States, including research or other related\ntransactions. Such approval and oversight operations shall\nbe conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices in consultation with other appropriate governmental\nentities. In identifying the involvement of Chinese entities", "entities. In identifying the involvement of Chinese entities\nor interests in the U.S. biotechnology sector, Congress should\ninclude firms and persons:\n\u25cb Engaged in genomic research;\n\u25cb Evaluating and/or reporting on genetic data, including for\nmedical or therapeutic purposes or ancestral documenta-\ntion;\n\u25cb Participating in pharmaceutical development;\n\u25cb Involved with U.S. colleges and universities; and\n\u25cb Involved with federal, state, or local governments or agen-\ncies and departments.\n(733)\n734\n\u2022 Support significant Federal Government investments in bio-\ntechnology in the United States and with U.S. entities at\nevery level of the technology development cycle and supply\nchain, from basic research through product development and\nmarket deployment, including investments in intermediate\nservices capacity and equipment manufacturing capacity.\n3.

Congress enact legislation prohibiting granting seats on boards\nof directors and information rights to China-based investors in\nstrategic technology sectors. Allowing foreign investors to hold\nseats and observer seats on the boards of U.S. technology start-\nups provides them with sensitive strategic information, which\ncould be leveraged to gain competitive advantages. Prohibiting\nthis practice would protect intellectual property and ensure that\nU.S. technological advances are not compromised. It would also\nreduce the risk of corporate espionage, safeguarding America\u2019s\nleadership in emerging technologies.\n6. Congress establish that:\n\u2022 The U.S. government will unilaterally or with key interna-\ntional partners seek to vertically integrate in the develop-\nment and commercialization of quantum technology.\n\u2022 Federal Government investments in quantum technology\nsupport every level of the technology development cycle and", "support every level of the technology development cycle and\nsupply chain from basic research through product develop-\nment and market deployment, including investments in in-\ntermediate services capacity.\n\u2022 The Office of Science and Technology Policy, in consultation\nwith appropriate agencies and experts, develop a Quantum\nTechnology Supply Chain Roadmap to ensure that the United\nStates coordinates outbound investment, U.S. critical supply\nchain assessments, the activities of the Committee on Foreign\nInvestment in the United States (CFIUS), and federally sup-\nported research activities to ensure that the United States,\n735\nalong with key allies and partners, will lead in this critical\ntechnology and not advance Chinese capabilities and devel-\nopment.\nChapter 4: Unsafe and Unregulated Chinese Consumer Goods:\nChallenges in Enforcing Import Regulations and Laws\nThe Commission recommends:\n7. With respect to imports sold through an online marketplace,", "The Commission recommends:\n7. With respect to imports sold through an online marketplace,\nCongress eliminate Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (also\nknown as the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption), which allows goods val-\nued under $800 to enter the United States duty free and, for\nall practical purposes, with less rigorous regulatory inspection.\nCongress should provide U.S. Customs and Border Protection\nadequate resources, including staff and technology, for imple-\nmentation, monitoring, and enforcement.\n8.

Among the tax\nexpenditures that would be eliminated prospectively are the\npreferential capital gains tax rate, the capital loss carry-for-\nward provisions, and the treatment of carried interest.\n16. To enhance the effectiveness of export controls, Congress should:\n\u2022 Improve the analytic and enforcement capabilities of the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security\n(BIS) by providing resources necessary to hire more in-house\n737", "(BIS) by providing resources necessary to hire more in-house\n737\nexperts; establish a Secretary\u2019s Fellows Program to more ef-\nfectively attract interagency talent; expand partnerships with\nthe national labs; increase access to data and data analysis\ntools, including the acquisition of proprietary datasets and\nmodern data analytic systems; and hire additional agents\nand analysts for the Office of Export Enforcement.\n\u2022 Amend the Export Control Reform Act to require that within\n30 days of granting a license for export to entities on the\nEntity List, including under the Foreign Direct Product Rule,\nBIS shall provide all relevant information about the license\napproval to the relevant congressional committees, subject to\nrestrictions on further disclosure under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 4820(h)(2)\n(B)(ii).\n\u2022 Direct the president to:\n\u25cb Designate a senior official to coordinate efforts across the\nAdministration to prioritize bilateral and multilateral sup-\nport for U.S. export control initiatives; and", "port for U.S. export control initiatives; and\n\u25cb Establish a Joint Interagency Task Force, reporting to and\noverseen by the national security advisor and with its own\nbudget and staff, to assess ways to achieve the goal of lim-\niting China\u2019s access to and development of advanced tech-\nnologies that pose a national security risk to the United\nStates.

In addition to direct\ninvestments, the notification regime should capture passive\ninvestment flows to help inform debates around the expan-\nsion of prohibitions to cover portfolio investment.\n18. Congress repeal Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for\nChina. The PNTR status allows China to benefit from the same\ntrade terms as U.S. allies, despite engaging in practices such as\nintellectual property theft and market manipulation.

Congress pass legislation eliminating the ability of entities\noperating in U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZs) to qualify for", "operating in U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZs) to qualify for\nzero or lower tariffs on products imported from China or Chi-\nnese-affiliated or -invested entities into the FTZ and then re-\nexported.\n24. The relevant committees of Congress hold hearings to assess\nthe desirability and feasibility of creating a trade defense co-\nalition with other like-minded countries to forestall the risk\nof a second China shock. Such a grouping would seek to align\npolicies for responding to the recent acceleration in China\u2019s ex-\nports of subsidized, underpriced materials and manufactured\ngoods.\nChapter 7: China\u2019s New Measures for Control, Mobilization,\nand Resilience\nThe Commission recommends:\n25.

Not later\nthan 60 days after its completion, the U.S. secretary of defense\nshall provide the report to the appropriate congressional com-\nmittees and brief them on its findings.\n27.

The greatest privilege, however, is to learn from the dedi-\ncated, knowledgeable staff who bring language skills, deep expertise,\ncuriosity, and, most of all, patience with the Commissioners as we\nwork toward a consensus of views.\nThis year, I voted for the report and believe it largely builds on\nthe Commission\u2019s record of understanding and providing policy\nrecommendations regarding China\u2019s efforts to consolidate control\ndomestically and expand its authority globally. Regrettably, there\nare two aspects of the report that reach beyond our commitment", "are two aspects of the report that reach beyond our commitment\nto provide China-based recommendations and raise concerns about\nunanticipated repercussions.\nWhile I support suspension of the de minimis trade exemption\nspecifically for Chinese e-commerce products because of concerns re-\ngarding safety hazards, forced labor, lack of enforcement related to\ncounterfeit products, and the imbalance of the exemption level (U.S.\nexemption is $800; China is $7), I disagree with the decision to elim-\ninate the provision in its entirety for e-commerce imports. Based on\nthe most recent data available from Customs & Border Protection\nauthorities, 42 percent of de minimis imports come from countries\nother than China. The Commission has spoken repeatedly about the\nneed to strengthen relations with emerging markets as we seek to\nbalance China\u2019s predatory political and economic practices. The de-\ncision to eliminate the de minimis exemption for e-commerce sales", "cision to eliminate the de minimis exemption for e-commerce sales\nfrom all countries was taken without consideration of the poten-\ntial damage that may be done to our relationships with Southeast\nAsian, Latin American, European, and African trading partners.\nMy second concern relates to our recommendation to eliminate\ncapital gains, capital loss carry-forward provisions, and the treat-\nment of carried interest for U.S. companies. This proposal was nei-\nther presented nor discussed in any Commission hearing, policy\npaper, or witness statement. While I agree with the spirit of the\nconcern that the United States should restrict investments in dan-\ngerous Chinese military enterprises, the implementation and con-\nsequences of this provision have not been evaluated.
