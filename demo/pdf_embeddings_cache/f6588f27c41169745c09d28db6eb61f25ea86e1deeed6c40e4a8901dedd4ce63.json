Decades of globalization, efficiency efforts, and\nunderinvestment in resilience have created structural risk in the way goods and inputs make their\nway to consumers and businesses. These supply chains have been severely tested in recent years\u2014by", "way to consumers and businesses. These supply chains have been severely tested in recent years\u2014by\npandemic, by conflict, and by natural disaster. In some cases, these shocks have forced government\nand private-sector actors to intervene to avoid major impacts. In others, these shocks have revealed\ndangerous vulnerabilities and created shortages that have harmed lives and livelihoods, interrupting\ncommerce for both large and small businesses. In all such cases, the world has become more alert to\nthe need for strong and reliable supply chains.\nThe U.S. Government, at the direction of President Biden and Vice President Harris, has responded\nto this challenge with a transformational focus on strengthening critical supply chains. In the early\ndays of the Administration, during the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s disruptions, President\nBiden launched a whole-of-government effort to assess and to build the resilience of our most", "Biden launched a whole-of-government effort to assess and to build the resilience of our most\ncritical supply chains: energy, agricultural commodities and food products, medical products,\ninformation and communications technology, transportation, and defense. As this Review\ndocuments, this work has seen enormous success, thanks to renewed investment in American\nmanufacturing in these sectors, stronger economic relationships with our allies and partners, and\nimproved capabilities within the federal government to monitor and respond to shocks that can\ndisrupt supply chains. Industry and state and local government partners have complemented this\nwork with an invigorated focus on supply chains as well to help ensure that people can get what they\nneed when they need it. Government and industry have found that strengthening supply chains\nthrough investment in domestic manufacturing and strategic industrial policy actions is effective and", "good for the economy\u2014as particularly evidenced by the supply chain healing\u2019s direct impact on\nbringing down inflation. Supply chain resilience is a shared priority with our allies and partners, too.\nIt has become a common feature of diplomatic engagements, which have produced results and laid\npromising foundations for deeper collaboration and more tactical deliverables in the years ahead.\nFour years later, strengthening our critical supply chains by investing in and protecting strategic\nsectors has become a whole-of-government priority that endures, even as supply chains have mostly\nrecovered from pandemic disruptions. A suite of new offices and resources across the federal\ngovernment have made this work possible, and the President\u2019s Council on Supply Chain Resilience\nconnects these teams and the capabilities they are developing to ensure continued strategic focus.\nHistoric legislation, including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS", "Historic legislation, including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS\n& Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, have provided foundational resources for these\nefforts. However, many critical sectors will need additional investment in the coming years.\nDespite this progress, significant risks remain, and much work is still needed to offset decades of\nweakening. This work also faces headwinds. Geopolitical tensions create uncertainty in key trade\nroutes and regions. The People\u2019s Republic of China continues to distort markets through non-\nmarket policies and practices, seeking to dominate key sectors by overwhelming global markets with\nexports.

These recommendations cover deployment of federal incentives and\nprocurement to attract private-sector investment in critical supply chains, and actions to insulate\nanalyses and actions from conflicts of interest, corruption, or the appearance of impropriety. The\nReview provides a strategic plan that includes diplomatic, economic, security, international\ndevelopment, trade, and other policy actions to guide U.S. engagement with allies and partners to\nstrengthen global supply chain resilience in critical sectors, as well as reforms to domestic and\ninternational trade rules and agreements that could be pursued to support supply chain resilience,\nsecurity, diversity, sustainability, and strength.

In\nFebruary 2021, Executive Order 14017 on America\u2019s Supply Chains clearly laid out this direction,\nasserting that the United States \u201cneeds resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains to ensure our\neconomic prosperity and national security.\u201d It mobilized a whole-of-government effort to assess and\nthen strengthen supply chains that were reeling from disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe federal government\u2014through a series of strategic reviews in 2021 and 2022\u2014took stock of\ncritical supply chains that support our nation\u2019s food, health care, connectivity and technology,\ntransportation, energy, and defense. While they documented acute impacts from the pandemic, these\nreviews also revealed structural vulnerabilities that were decades in the making, the result of years of", "outsourcing, offshoring, and streamlining. These shifts had the aim of lowering upfront costs and\nimproving regular-order efficiency, but were paired with a deep underinvestment in resilience that\nleft increasingly complex and sprawling supply chains unable to cope with disruption. The granular\nfindings from these strategic reviews also revealed significant opportunities that have inspired and\nguided federal efforts to make these supply chains more robust and to harness the benefits of strong\nsupply chains for American workers and businesses.\nEconomic research since the onset of the pandemic has revealed the ripple effects that supply chain\ndisruptions can cause throughout the broader macroeconomy, as evidenced in the U.S. and globally.\nOn top of acute disruptions that can cause shortfalls in supply of critical goods, snarled supply\nchains were one of the primary drivers of inflation following the onset of the pandemic. An", "chains were one of the primary drivers of inflation following the onset of the pandemic.

In addition, when production of critical key inputs\u2014\nsuch as semiconductors\u2014are overly concentrated in a limited number of geographies, it can\nintroduce outsized supply chain risks as regional shocks propagate into broader economic impacts.\nRecent experience has starkly demonstrated that modern supply chains that are highly concentrated\nmay be insufficiently resilient. Dependencies across supply chains threaten resilience when discrete\nshocks affecting just one supply chain segment ripple through the broader global economy. For\nexample, when individual firms halted operations during the pandemic, even in just one part of the\nworld, sectoral supply shocks occurred that drove up prices globally. Information asymmetries\nacross suppliers likely made it more difficult to recover from the shock when suppliers were unable\nto communicate and coordinate effectively to restart operations.

In 2023, Houthi rebels began attacking cargo ships in the critical\nRed Sea waterway, but\u2014along with a military response in coordination with allies and partners\u2014the\nAdministration\u2019s approach to supply chains also began to take stride, with the experienced teams\nformalized into new supply chain functions at multiple agencies and the launch of the White House\nCouncil on Supply Chain Resilience to coordinate supply chain strategy and capabilities across the\nfederal government. The Council has also worked to build and institutionalize the knowledge, data,", "federal government. The Council has also worked to build and institutionalize the knowledge, data,\nand capabilities that the U.S. Government has developed through these crises\u2014including\nstrengthening supply chain analytics, risk management, and disruption response.\nImproving our response to disruptions\nThe Administration took office during a time of major supply chain disruptions, including\nsignificant congestion in ocean shipping due to pandemic supply and demand imbalances. However,\nthe federal government lacked an existing mechanism to harness federal resources, which were\nspread across multiple departments and agencies, to effectively address supply chain challenges. In\nJune 2021, President Biden created the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force (SCDTF) to bring\ntogether departments and agencies with a range of relevant tools and authorities, from the Defense\nProduction Act to key data and analytical tools to resources for impacted workers and small", "Production Act to key data and analytical tools to resources for impacted workers and small\nbusinesses. The SCDTF coordinated these federal authorities and resources and also established a\nprocess to work with state and local authorities and the private sector in real time. The SCDTF\u2019s\n-11-\nprivate\u2013public coordination improved the flow of goods into and around the United States\u2014getting\nproducts critical to American families moving again through ports and to shelves.\nEven as the country recovered from pandemic-induced supply chain shocks, the SCDTF continued\nto mobilize to respond to new and unexpected supply chain disruptions. Some departments and\nagencies bring key tools and authorities to the table, such as the Defense Production Act or\nresources to support impacted workers and small businesses, while other departments and agencies\nbring key insights from deep relationships with industry or key data and analytics. The SCDTF", "bring key insights from deep relationships with industry or key data and analytics. The SCDTF\ncoordinated preparations for potential service interruptions on North American railroads and at\nports in 2022, 2023, and 2024. It facilitated a rapid response to address supply chain bottlenecks\nfollowing the sudden shutdown of operations at the Port of Baltimore due to the 2024 collapse of\nthe Francis Scott Key Bridge. It also managed disruptions to the flow of key goods arising from\nnatural disasters, including hurricanes and severe winter storms. In each situation, the SCDTF\ndeployed a tested playbook to convene the core group of federal agencies that handle supply chains,\ndevelop a clear workplan, and monitor response efforts until the situation was sufficiently addressed.\nBesides responding to active disruptions, the U.S. Government has also worked to build preparation\nfor potential future ones. Over the past year, multiple federal agencies have run tabletop exercises to", "examine the actions, authorities, and decision-making timelines for supporting recovery from a\ndisruption. These discussions reinforced the continued importance of contingency planning,\ninteragency cooperation, and communication, including along the United States\u2019 geographic borders.\nSupply chains are not static, and some level of disruption is inevitable. However, these efforts\ndemonstrate that a rapid, smart federal response\u2014combined with close collaboration with industry,\nlabor, state and local governments, allies and partners, and other groups\u2014can significantly mitigate\nnegative impacts and accelerate resolution.\nInvesting in American manufacturing\nA robust American manufacturing base is at the core of resilient and secure supply chains. Over the\npast four years, the Biden\u2013Harris Administration has shepherded in a new era of investment in\nmanufacturing. Using strategically allocated resources from major legislation, federal investments\u2014", "manufacturing. Using strategically allocated resources from major legislation, federal investments\u2014\nincluding loans, grants, tax credits, procurements, and other mechanisms primarily funded by BIL,\nthe IRA, and the CHIPS and Science Act\u2014have unleashed over $1 trillion in announced private-\nsector investment in clean energy and manufacturing since 2021. Of this total, $796 billion is in new\nAmerican manufacturing. For example, the CHIPS and Science Act is investing nearly $53 billion in\nU.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and workforce, driving over $446\nbillion in announced private investment. Figure 2 illustrates this breakdown across critical sectors.\n-12-\nFigure 2: U.S. Government and private-sector announced investments in critical sectors since\n2021\nSource: Private investment announcements are from invest.gov as of December 11, 2024. Federal investment", "announcements reflect loans, grants, preliminary memorandums of terms, certain tax credits, and other awards and\nallocations by the Departments of Energy, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services, and Commerce since January\n20, 2021, as of early December 2024.\nThese investments have already produced a slew of factories and facilities across the country that\nbenefit multiple critical industrial bases, for example:\n\u2022 Ultium Cells opened a battery cell manufacturing facility in Warren, Ohio, which employs\napproximately 2,200 employees and has already produced 100 million battery cells.\n\u2022 Boom Supersonic invested $500 million in a new factory in Greensboro, North Carolina, to\nmanufacture supersonic airliners.\n\u2022 Nokia opened a manufacturing facility in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, to produce Buy\nAmerica\u2013compliant fiber-optic products for broadband investments being funded by BIL.\n\u2022 Luxwall is investing $165 million in two clean energy manufacturing facilities in Michigan to", "\u2022 Luxwall is investing $165 million in two clean energy manufacturing facilities in Michigan to\nproduce high-volume vacuum-insulating glass, creating 450 good-paying jobs. The Litchfield\nfactory is already online, and the Detroit factory\u2014which is located on the site of a former\ncoal-generation plant and supported by a $31.7-million grant funded by BIL\u2014is anticipated\nto open in 2026.\nThe Administration is also providing other kinds of incentives for manufacturers to onshore\nproduction of certain critical items. This impact can be seen for solar components and modules\u2014\nthrough the 48C Advanced Energy Projects tax credit, $71 million in awards to advance research,\ndevelopment, and demonstration projects, and $7 billion in Solar for All grants to support solar\ndeployment. These actions are energizing domestic solar investment. For example, in 2024, First\nSolar inaugurated its $1.1-billion photovoltaic (PV) solar module manufacturing facility in Lawrence", "County, Alabama, which is expected to create over 800 new jobs. Combined with the company's\nthree operating factories in Ohio, First Solar will have a vertically integrated solar manufacturing\ncapacity of 11 gigawatts (GW), and yet another 3.5-GW and $1.1-billion factory is under\n-13-\nconstruction in Louisiana, expected to come online in 2025. Many factories are also currently under\nconstruction and projected to come online in 2025 and beyond. For example, in Cedartown,\nGeorgia, SolarCycle is investing $400 million in the largest solar panel recycling facility in the\ncountry that will process an estimated 25 to 30 percent of domestic retired solar panels in 2030, as\nwell as $344 million in a solar glass plant with an annual capacity of 6 GW, supported by a $64-\nmillion 48C Advanced Energy Projects and 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credits (as\ndisclosed by the taxpayer). These plants are scheduled to be operational in 2025 and 2026 and have", "disclosed by the taxpayer). These plants are scheduled to be operational in 2025 and 2026 and have\nalready secured partnerships with domestic solar manufacturers.\nImportantly, this new American manufacturing capacity is not just for American consumers\u2014it also\nhelps diversify global supply chains through exports. For example, in 2022, the U.S. Export\u2013Import\nBank (EXIM) created the Make More in America Initiative (MMIA), allowing EXIM for the first\ntime to support domestic projects that expand the United States\u2019 export capacity. Since its creation,\nMMIA has provided nearly $300 million to companies establishing and returning supply chains to\nthe United States. The Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also\nannounced and finalized rules for the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, which will spur\nU.S. clean energy manufacturing through tax credits and strengthen U.S. energy security.", "U.S. clean energy manufacturing through tax credits and strengthen U.S. energy security.\nAdditionally, the Biden\u2013Harris Administration recognized the importance of using the power of the\nfederal purse to support American industry. In 2021, President Biden created the Made in America\nOffice (MIAO) in the Office of Management and Budget to help ensure that federal dollars are\nbeing leveraged to drive investment, promote good-paying, high quality American jobs, and\nstrengthen the U.S. manufacturing base. In November 2021, as part of BIL, President Biden signed\nthe Build America Buy America Act, which established domestic content preferences for federal\nfinancial assistance for infrastructure. The Administration also made the strongest changes to Buy\nAmerican rules in nearly seven decades by increasing the domestic content threshold for federal\nprocurement from 55 percent to 65 percent in 2024\u2014and that threshold is set to be raised again to", "procurement from 55 percent to 65 percent in 2024\u2014and that threshold is set to be raised again to\n75 percent in 2029.19 MIAO has also issued guidance on enhanced price preference and industrial\nmobilization that would help agencies better leverage federal procurement dollars to strengthen\ndomestic sourcing for critical products, mitigate associated supply chain risks, and take a focused\napproach to supporting domestic industries. Additionally, MIAO has worked to orchestrate a federal\nprocurement \u201cdemand signal\u201d across critical industries, including semiconductors, transformers,\nheat pumps, forgings and castings, renewable energy, broadband, port equipment and infrastructure,\nEV charging, water infrastructure components, and personal protective equipment (PPE) and\ntextiles.\nCreating a level playing field for American businesses to compete and workers to thrive\nOn a level playing field, American businesses and workers can compete and win.

The Biden\u2013Harris Administration has developed a strategy to\naddress these NMPP, discussed more in depth later in this Review. Persistent intellectual property\ntheft and forced technology transfers also undermine American businesses\u2019 ability to freely innovate\nand compete. To counteract the burden that China\u2019s technology transfer related acts, policies, and\npractices impose on American businesses and workers, the Biden\u2013Harris Administration raised\ntariffs on a select number of key sectors to safeguard critical U.S. supply chains in the face of unfair\ncompetition. These tariff modifications will protect historic domestic investments under BIL, the\nCHIPS and Science Act, and the IRA, while also shielding American businesses and workers from\nunfair trade practices.\nTogether, these investments and actions have corresponded with a post-pandemic economic\nrecovery unlike any other recovery in recent decades. Overall employment now exceeds pre-", "recovery unlike any other recovery in recent decades. Overall employment now exceeds pre-\npandemic levels, with more than 16 million jobs added since President Biden and Vice President\nHarris took office. During this Administration, roughly 355,000 new jobs were created each month.\nAmerican entrepreneurs have filed over 20 million new business applications during this time, the\nmost in any single presidential term in history. In addition, manufacturing has seen a remarkable\nrecovery, with the U.S. economy adding more than 1.6 million manufacturing and construction jobs\nsince January 2021, including 700,000 manufacturing jobs alone. As illustrated in Figure 3, this\nincrease in the manufacturing workforce is historically large and fast compared to other post-\nrecession recoveries in recent decades that saw net declines in the manufacturing workforce.

Prior to the pandemic, the U.S.\nGovernment had few mechanisms to coordinate globally on supply chains. Under the Biden\u2013Harris\nAdministration, the United States has worked with allies and partners to develop channels to warn\nof potential disruptions, react and respond in real time to acute supply challenges, and diversify\nlong-term trade and investment. The United States alone cannot combat the myriad of challenges\nthat threaten the global economy, and it remains vital to work closely with allies and partners to\nshare information, finance opportunities that support efforts to diversify supply chains and enhance", "our collective prosperity, and push back against anticompetitive practices that threaten critical\nindustries. Together, the United States and our partners can also shape the rules of the road on\nimportant environmental protections and labor standards that underpin all of our markets.\nDiversifying supply chain sources is an important element of resilience. Domestic producers alone\ncannot produce every component of every supply chain. However, overreliance on any one market\nputs U.S. supply chains at risk of disruption from natural disasters or geopolitical tensions. The U.S.\nGovernment must work with partners to develop economic collaboration that minimizes\ndependencies and chokepoints and improves our mutual resilience.\nRecognizing this imperative, the Administration has undertaken robust efforts to strengthen\ncoordination on supply chains with allies and partners over the past four years. In October 2021,", "coordination on supply chains with allies and partners over the past four years. In October 2021,\nPresident Biden convened over a dozen world leaders to improve international collaboration on\nsupply chain resilience, demonstrating the Administration\u2019s commitment to learning from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic to make global supply chains more transparent, diverse, secure, and\nsustainable. Through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF)\nand Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity (APEP), the federal government is preparing for\npotential disruptions, talking to workers and businesses directly about improving labor conditions\nacross supply chains, and making long-term plans for economic resilience in key sectors across the\nIndo-Pacific and Western Hemisphere.\nThe U.S. Government is also making long-term investments in global supply chain resilience,\npartnering with the private sector through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation", "partnering with the private sector through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation\n(DFC) and EXIM to produce solar energy and unlock access to critical minerals in Angola, develop\ncontainer ports in Ecuador, and finance health projects worldwide.

Critical\ninfrastructure, defined in the Patriot Act of 2001, comprises the physical and virtual assets and\nsystems so vital to the nation that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact", "on national security, national economic security, or national public health or safety. Critical\ninfrastructure cannot be secure and resilient without secure and resilient supply chains, and the\nAdministration has taken steps to ensure supply chains are prioritized in federal risk management\nefforts. In April 2024, President Biden signed a new National Security Memorandum on Critical\nInfrastructure Security and Resilience (NSM-22) which established a two-year risk management cycle\nacross the sixteen designated critical infrastructure sectors, and tasked the Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with publishing a National Infrastructure Risk Management\nPlan. Subsequently, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated the identification and mitigation\nof supply chain vulnerabilities as one of five priority risk areas which should be addressed as part of\nthe whole-of-government risk management effort.

The forthcoming sector-specific risk management\nplans and National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan, which will be completed in 2025, will\ncommunicate to critical infrastructure stakeholders how the U.S. Government will prioritize risk\nmanagement efforts, including for related supply chain vulnerabilities.\nMaking supply chain resilience an enduring U.S. Government priority\nDisruptions early in the Administration required immediate response. However, the root causes of\nthose disruptions had been years in the making, the result of decades of different policy and private\nsector decisions. The Administration has affirmed that resilient supply chains are a matter of\neconomic and national security and must remain an enduring focus for the federal government.\n-17-\nAccordingly, across both the White House and federal agencies, the Administration has taken action\nto integrate and institutionalize supply chain resilience as a lasting priority.", "to integrate and institutionalize supply chain resilience as a lasting priority.\nIn 2023, President Biden created the White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience to advance\nthis work over the long term. The Council includes representation across the federal government to\nreflect the multifaceted nature of supply chain resilience. Pursuant to Executive Order 14123, the\nCouncil coordinates and promotes federal efforts to strengthen long-term supply chain resilience\nand American industrial competitiveness. It identifies and provides a coordinated response to\naddress supply chain insecurities, threats, and vulnerabilities, including excessive geographic or\nsupplier concentration. And it facilitates collaboration with allies and partners to foster greater global\nsupply chain resilience.\nSupply chain resilience has also become more embedded into the ways that federal agencies operate.\nThe Department of Commerce has launched a Supply Chain Center that is integrating industry", "The Department of Commerce has launched a Supply Chain Center that is integrating industry\nexpertise and data analytics to develop innovative supply chain risk assessment tools, particularly the\nnew SCALE tool (see more detail on page 29), and sharper \u201cdeep-dive\u201d analyses on select critical\nsupply chains to drive targeted actions to increase resilience. Since its inception, the Center has built\nbroad, enduring partnerships across government, industry, and academia. At the Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS), a new Supply Chain Resilience Center is dedicated to the resilience of\nsupply chains which are crucial for homeland security.

For many years, the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC) has used comprehensive non-market policies and practices to advance its own\neconomy, including through industrial targeting, non-market excess capacity, large and\npervasive state subsidies at the national and local levels, underpriced credit, opaque and", "pervasive state subsidies at the national and local levels, underpriced credit, opaque and\ndiscriminatory regulations, and other measures. These actions distort markets, undercut fair\ncompetition, produce harmful consequences that create single-market dependencies on the\nPRC, weaken global supply chains, and can lead to severe and persistent excess capacity. The\nBiden\u2013Harris Administration has taken action to respond to these problematic behaviors,\nincluding by developing a strategy to respond to non-market policies and practices. The\nAdministration has also imposed tariffs on strategic sectors where the PRC has continued to\nemploy non-market policies and practices. However, the United States must continue to\nwork with allies and partners on joint or coordinated responses to the PRC\u2019s behavior,\nprotecting investments, and promoting supply chain resilience.\n\u2022 Trade measures.

Many recent cybersecurity incidents have been linked to supply chain risks. These\nincidents are not isolated events; many recent reports suggest these attacks are increasing in\nfrequency. The combination of digitization and reliance on suppliers to support critical\nfunctions creates numerous cybersecurity risks to organizations. Adversaries are increasingly\nusing attack vectors to compromise software supply chains, including the software\ndevelopment process, open-source repositories, update and patching mechanisms, and cloud\ninfrastructure.

The\ninterconnectedness of the global economy means that collaboration with allies and partners on\nsupply chain resilience is more important than ever before. The United States cannot singlehandedly\nproduce every key element in every critical supply chain, but in coordination with our international\npartners, the U.S. can minimize its vulnerability to disruptions and economic coercion while\nmaximizing collective opportunity.

The U.S. Government must continue preparing American workers for the\neconomy of tomorrow, ensuring they have the technical expertise they need to thrive in the labor\nforce across each core industrial base.\nMobilizing and protecting private investment, including through U.S. Government\neconomic tools. Improving the United States\u2019 economic resilience will require using and building\nupon the full suite of the U.S. Government economic tools to both mobilize and protect private\ninvestment.

Overreliance on individual overseas markets limited U.S. access to key\nproducts and inputs, and the federal government lacked the mechanisms and analytics to support a\ncoordinated response. In the four years since, the United States has undertaken historic efforts to\ninvest in supply chain resilience, strengthen the industrial bases critical to American economic and\nnational security, and ensure the federal government has the tools, capacity, and partnerships it\nneeds to support supply chains in the future.\nFrom issuing an Executive Order on America\u2019s Supply Chains one month after taking office to\ncreating the White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience and Supply Chain Disruptions Task\nForce, this Administration has made the economic health and prosperity of supply chains a whole-", "Force, this Administration has made the economic health and prosperity of supply chains a whole-\nof-government priority.

Given the scope and consequences of the\nPRC\u2019s NMPP, the Biden\u2013Harris Administration has worked to overhaul U.S. efforts to combatting\nNMPP and to more effectively mitigate the harms outlined above before they happen. The\nfollowing are essential elements of a comprehensive NMPP response:\n\u2022 Systematic and continuous U.S. Government coordination and analysis to identify\nsectors vulnerable to NMPP or industrial targeting and early indicators of other countries\u2019\nuse of NMPP;", "use of NMPP;\n\u2022 Early and comprehensive U.S. Government action through affirmative and restrictive\nmeasures\u2014including investment, trade actions, procurement, and market standards\u2014\ncapable of nimbly responding to and deterring NMPP or other evolving industrial targeting\ntactics;\n\u2022 Strengthened U.S. NMPP and economic resilience toolkit; and\n\u2022 Collaboration with domestic stakeholders and allies and partners on analysis,\nresponses, and messaging to limit NMPP and their impacts.\nThis shift away from insufficient policies of reaction to comprehensive policies of prevention is a\nhallmark of the Biden\u2013Harris Administration\u2019s approach to U.S. supply chain resilience.

Quarterly interagency meetings to brief on\nNMPP activity\u2014and the economic impacts of those policies in global and domestic markets\u2014are\nnecessary to inform and calibrate ongoing U.S. Government efforts. National Security Council and\nNational Economic Council staff should continue interagency convenings at least quarterly to\nmaintain implementation of this overall strategy, including by facilitating discussion of: (1) regularly\nupdated assessments of potential NMPP and impacted products or sectors, (2) NMPP response\noptions and plans, (3) reviews of impact and/or effectiveness of U.S. countermeasures, and (4)", "options and plans, (3) reviews of impact and/or effectiveness of U.S. countermeasures, and (4)\nengagement with allies and partners.\nTo inform interagency discussions, the U.S. Government has regularly assessed relevant policy and\neconomic indicators, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 National and subnational NMPP;\n\u2022 Economic indicators, both in the aggregate and for sectors subject to industrial targeting,\nincluding those where the United States has already taken action;\n\u2022 Risks to U.S. supply chains from direct or indirect over-reliance on PRC sources and factors\nof production;\n\u2022 Impact of NMPP on allies, partners, and other countries;\n\u2022 Effectiveness of U.S. countermeasures;\n\u2022 Other factors, as appropriate.\nThese assessments and interagency convenings have been instrumental in shaping U.S. responses to\nNMPP and coordinating actions with allies and partners under the Biden\u2013Harris Administration.

Early and Comprehensive Responses for At-Risk Sectors\nEarly, comprehensive responses to NMPP are necessary to promote U.S. economic security and\nresilience. The Biden\u2013Harris Administration has deployed a wide-ranging toolkit to address the\nstrategic and economic impacts of NMPP through the following types of measures. To effectively", "strategic and economic impacts of NMPP through the following types of measures. To effectively\ncombat NMPP and promote U.S. economic security, the U.S. Government should continue to\nconsider and leverage this suite of tools, in addition to trade measures.\nSupply Chain Transparency and Traceability. Increased supply chain transparency, particularly\nin critical supply chains, is necessary to identify vulnerabilities and dependencies and tailor NMPP\nresponses to address them and is an important element of a comprehensive NMPP response.\nExisting traceability requirements, including those incorporated into the forced labor import ban,\nthe Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act, the Defense Production Act, and sourcing requirements\nand restrictions on particular tax incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act Section 30D Clean\nVehicle Credit, have demonstrated the capacity for companies to map sourcing and production", "Vehicle Credit, have demonstrated the capacity for companies to map sourcing and production\nthroughout supply chains, and have contributed to NMPP responses in critical sectors.

Domestic investments and incentives, like the Inflation\nReduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS and Science Act, and similar investments\nby allies and partners, can be central to a NMPP response by promoting increased U.S. and allied\nproduction when other actions, such as trade enforcement, are insufficient by themselves. However,\n-41-\nsupply-side policies and investments may be undermined or less effective if not paired with", "-41-\nsupply-side policies and investments may be undermined or less effective if not paired with\nadditional countermeasures, particularly for sectors in which markets and prices are set globally.\nProcurement. The U.S. Government is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world,\nand the Biden\u2013Harris Administration has made it a priority to ensure U.S.-taxpayer-funded\npurchases benefit U.S. taxpayers and U.S. industries. Although federal procurement alone is typically\ninsufficient to sustain a domestic industry, procurement policies shape markets and can be an\nimportant complement to domestic investments and other actions intended to create a level playing\nfield for U.S. producers in the face of NMPP. In his first week in office, President Biden signed\nExecutive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in America by All of America\u2019s Workers, to promote\nconsistent application of Made in America laws and to establish the Made in America Office at the", "consistent application of Made in America laws and to establish the Made in America Office at the\nOffice of Management and Budget to oversee these efforts. Ongoing enforcement of Made in\nAmerica laws is critical to leveraging procurement policy as part of NMPP responses and in support\nof industrial and supply chain resilience objectives.\nDepartments and agencies also have authorities that can require certain standards or domestic\nsourcing for procured items, as in the case of industrial mobilization authority, which should be\nconsidered a potential component of U.S. countermeasures. Furthermore, the Trade Agreement Act\n(TAA) prohibits procurement purchases from any non-TAA designated countries, unless domestic\nor TAA suppliers are unable to provide the product or service for TAA covered procurement. The\nTAA designates the authority to the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to negotiate\ncoverage under TAA. These procurement negotiations could provide an opportunity for the U.S.", "coverage under TAA. These procurement negotiations could provide an opportunity for the U.S.\nGovernment to coordinate with allies and partners to implement similar purchasing prohibitions. In\naddition, other federal procurement opportunities, such as power purchase agreements, present\nopportunities to support U.S. producers at risk of NMPP harm and to prevent NMPP-benefiting\nproducers from benefiting from U.S. Government procurement.\nMarket Standards. Similarly, market standards can play an important role in NMPP responses.\nMarket standards refer to policies that require products to meet certain standards to enter the U.S.\nmarket. These can be complemented by voluntary industry standards that the United States and\nallies and partners encourage private sector entities to adopt. The United States already has market\nstandards that serve a variety of purposes, including to keep U.S. consumers and infrastructure safe", "and to level the playing field for U.S. producers. Prominent examples include the forced labor\nimport ban, consumer product safety standards, and federal motor vehicle safety standards. Other\nmarket standards should also be considered to create a level playing field for U.S. manufacturers.\nFor example, market standards based on economic security criteria could be developed for the\nincorporation of key components in critical sectors to reduce vulnerabilities. Moreover, trade\nmeasures could be put in place to prevent carbon dumping of emissions-intensive goods.\nAdditionally, market standards on labor rights, environmental standards, and traceability of products\ncould help to strengthen U.S. supply chain resilience and competitiveness and promote supply chain\ndiversification, particularly in the clean energy and critical minerals sectors.\nIII. Strengthening the U.S. NMPP and Economic Resilience Toolkit", "III.

U.S.\ndata collection laws currently limit the ability to share trade, manufacturing, and supply chain data\ncollected for other purposes, even within the U.S. Government. Relevant statutes should be updated\nto facilitate the collection, collation, and sharing of data on critical sectors, while protecting business\nconfidentiality. In addition, statutory changes are needed to require importers to disclose the\ncomponents of specific imported final products, or the intended use of imported component parts,\nwhen such information is critical to the U.S. Government\u2019s ability to craft NMPP response and\nmitigate NMPP impacts.", "mitigate NMPP impacts.\nSupply Chains. U.S. laws should be strengthened to address systematic use of NMPP by the PRC\nto achieve market domination of entire supply chains, including final products, intermediate goods,\nand key components and materials. U.S. economic resilience tools are primarily focused on specific\nproducts, without regard to upstream or downstream products that may also be affected by strategic\nuse of NMPP to achieve market domination. For example, Title VII limits the ability of domestic\nproducers of inputs or components to participate in an investigation on a finished product. One\nexception is Section 232, which allows action to be taken against imports and their derivative\nproducts on the basis of a threat to national security but does not explicitly provide for action to be\ntaken throughout a supply chain.

Relatedly, Section 301 could explicitly recognize\nthe negotiation of sectoral agreements with allies and partners to help achieve these policy goals.\nTransnational Subsidies. U.S. laws should be updated to explicitly provide for action against\ntransnational subsidies, which the PRC frequently deploys to achieve domination of global sectors.\nUnder the Biden\u2013Harris Administration, Commerce revoked a prior regulation that was curtailing it\nfrom addressing transnational subsidies in countervailing duty proceedings, which is a significant\nimprovement to the U.S. NMPP toolkit. Bipartisan, bicameral legislation pending in Congress would\ncodify Commerce\u2019s authority to address transnational subsidies and to address circumstances where", "codify Commerce\u2019s authority to address transnational subsidies and to address circumstances where\nshifting production threatens to undermine Commerce\u2019s trade enforcement actions.\nCircumvention. U.S. trade laws do not all contain circumvention prevention provisions, which can\nmake responses to NMPP vulnerable to evasion. Section 201 and Section 301 could be updated to\nadd circumvention procedures to address the misclassification of products or transshipment through\nthird countries. Furthermore, global or broad trade remedies can help to guard against evasion of\nNMPP actions achieved by shifting production or export to different countries, and U.S. trade laws\ncould be clarified, as appropriate, to provide this flexibility.\n-43-\nNMPP producers also may seek to avoid U.S. enforcement actions and other border-based measures\nby investing in U.S.-based operations.

The PRC is actively supporting and deploying that tactic in\nEuropean Union Member States to avoid recently imposed EU tariffs on PRC EV imports. In\naddition, the United States and other countries have seen an uptick in PRC investment in the solar\nsector following the imposition of U.S. trade enforcement actions against PRC solar exports and\nafter investigations into circumvention of those duties. The U.S. Government should monitor the\nthreat of these investments in the United States and develop an appropriate policy response, as\nnecessary.\nAction Before Harms. Not all trade laws clearly provide for enforcement action before a U.S.\nindustry is affected by NMPP. The standards vary by statute, and, in practice, relief is most often\nprovided only after domestic producers have already experienced demonstrable harm. After-the-fact\nresponses make it harder to achieve full recovery or competitiveness of a U.S. industry, particularly", "when the PRC has been expending substantial resources to build up a targeted domestic industry\nbefore unleashing it on the foreign competition. Title VII allows U.S. firms to seek relief when\nproduction is materially retarded by imports, such as when a new domestic industry is seeking to\ncome online but imports are too overwhelming to allow for growth. This provision has been used\nsparingly, though, and future Administrations should consider how to more aggressively use this\ntool. To provide for swifter action, Section 201 could be updated to allow for provisional measures,\neven if time-limited, to be put in place while the International Trade Committee investigatory\nprocess is completed. Additionally, Section 301 could be updated to explicitly recognize\ninvestigations and action can be taken before domestic producers are harmed by the impact of\nNMPP and even if there is not yet an existing U.S. industry.", "NMPP and even if there is not yet an existing U.S. industry.\nTariff Code Updates. Furthermore, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS)\ncould be updated to allow for more precise targeting of imports with trade actions and any tariff rate\nupdates considered by Congress. Certain technical reforms to the HTSUS could help to distinguish\namong various critical minerals. Other reforms could help to disaggregate tariff lines that comingle\nproducts with very different end uses, such as salad spinners and centrifuges for laboratories. More\nsignificant changes could also be considered. Modifications to the HTSUS, or authorities to modify\nthe HTSUS, could help to ensure NMPP responses can be effectively implemented to promote\nAmerican industrial competitiveness and economic resilience.\nUpdating the U.S. NMPP toolkit will help the U.S. Government better respond to the PRC\u2019s\nevolving tactics and facilitate early, effective action to protect U.S. economic security and create a", "level playing field for U.S. workers and businesses.\nIV. Collaboration with domestic stakeholders and allies and partners\nDomestic Stakeholders. Domestic stakeholders, including but not limited to industry, workers\u2019\nrepresentatives, and state and local governments, should help to shape the overall U.S.\nGovernment\u2019s NMPP response efforts. Specifically, stakeholder views should be reflected in the\nannual list of at-risk sectors and the comprehensive response plans. Moreover, stakeholder\nengagement can help to inform industry about the risks of NMPP and potential approaches to\nmitigate those risks. USTR and Commerce, in coordination with other departments and agencies,\nshould utilize Federal Advisory Committees and other regular channels of communication with a\n-44-\nvariety of stakeholders to facilitate ongoing exchanges of information and reinforced messaging on\nthe U.S. Government NMPP response strategy, as appropriate.", "the U.S. Government NMPP response strategy, as appropriate.\nAllies and Partners. Coordination of comprehensive NMPP countermeasures with allies and\npartners will increase their impact and more effectively promote fair competition in the United\nStates and the global market. The Biden\u2013Harris Administration has prioritized NMPP collaboration\nwith allies and partners and on supply chain resilience with significant results. The Group of Seven\n(G7) countries have issued statements underscoring shared concerns about the threats of NMPP\nand economic coercion, as well as the importance of economic security, the harms caused by PRC\novercapacity, and a commitment to partner on supply chain resilience efforts. Earlier this year, the\nG7 leaders announced their intention to coordinate efforts on economic resilience, which Canada\nhas committed to taking forward as a central pillar of its presidency next year.", "has committed to taking forward as a central pillar of its presidency next year.\nTariffs on electric vehicles imposed by allies and partners demonstrate the potential and the impact\nof coordinated action. President Biden announced a 100-percent tariff on PRC electric vehicles in\nMay 2024. In August, Canada announced it would also increase to 100-percent tariffs on PRC\nelectric vehicles and examine the need for tariffs on other products to address NMPP. And after\ncompleting its own trade investigation, the European Union began applying tariffs up to 35 percent\nin October\u2014in addition to the 10-percent duty on imports from all countries\u2014on PRC electric\nvehicle imports.\nTo maintain this momentum, ongoing engagement with allies and partners to share assessments and\ndiscuss effective policy responses is imperative. The Department of State has coordinated U.S.\noutreach to allies and partners, including analysis of actions taken by allies and partners to respond", "to NMPP, and is well suited to continue this work in coordination with the interagency. The future\npublication of the U.S. annual list of sectors at risk of NMPP harms would serve as a useful basis for\nthese international engagements.\nAdvancing NMPP concerns in multilateral settings, such as the Organisation of Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), should also be\ncoordinated with allies and partners. These efforts can help to raise awareness of the global\neconomic harms of NMPP and the need to adopt countermeasures to increase supply chain\nresilience, reduce the risk of economic coercion, and promote a level playing field. This includes\nwork to raise awareness of how NMPP harm developing countries and undermine their\nindustrialization goals, including by impeding efforts to establish new industries and by preventing\ndeveloping countries from moving up the value chain in sectors of interest. Treasury, USTR,", "developing countries from moving up the value chain in sectors of interest. Treasury, USTR,\nCommerce, and State should maintain these efforts in the future.\nConclusion\nEarly, comprehensive responses to NMPP have been central to the Biden\u2013Harris Administration\u2019s\nefforts to promote American industrial competitiveness and economic resilience and fair\ncompetition throughout the global economy. Continued implementation of this NMPP strategy is\nessential to creating a level playing field for U.S. industries and workers and to achieving supply\nchain resilience in the critical sectors identified in this Review.\n-45-\n2021\u20132024 F - R\nOUR YEAR EVIEW\nS C\nOF UPPLY HAINS FOR\nE S\nTHE NERGY ECTOR\nI B\nNDUSTRIAL ASE\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\nDECEMBER 2024\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe U.S. Government is advancing a more secure and diversified energy sector industrial\nbase to support an evolving energy system.

The Biden\u2013Harris Administration has taken historic\nsteps to accelerate the deployment of these technologies and bolster supply chains, ensuring a\nresilient and sustainable energy future for the nation. By addressing these challenges, the United\nStates can maintain its leadership in the global energy market and secure a prosperous future for\ngenerations to come.\nEvolution of the U.S. Energy Sector Industrial Base\nThe United States energy sector has undergone significant changes in the past two decades and will\ncontinue to evolve at an accelerated pace in the next 30 years due to rapid innovation, investment\ntrends in private capital markets, and the urgent need to combat global climate change.

Non-market practices by\nPRC such as overproduction of supply have also distorted global markets. This pattern has had\nconsequences for the American worker, with communities across the United States grappling with\ndeindustrialization as scores of manufacturing facilities jobs moved overseas.\nIn 2019, the U.S. achieved the long-held goal of producing more energy than it consumed, driven in\nlarge part by the development of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling over more than a\ndecade.26 Today, the U.S. is the leading crude producer in the world, accounting for nearly 20\npercent of the world\u2019s total oil production and producing more oil annually than any country in\nhuman history.27 In the U.S., as of 2023, about 84 percent of primary energy end-use and 60 percent", "human history.27 In the U.S., as of 2023, about 84 percent of primary energy end-use and 60 percent\nof electricity generation came from fossil fuels, including petroleum, natural gas, and coal (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.

This will\nrequire the U.S. to establish a strategy to accelerate energy production and drive towards energy\nindependence with a broad portfolio of technologies. To combat the climate crisis and avoid the\nmost severe impacts of climate change, the United States has made several notable commitments\nthat will require evolution in our energy sector:\n\u2022 Achieving a 50- to 52-percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse\ngas pollution by 2030\n\u2022 Creating a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035\n\u2022 Achieving net zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050.29\nWhile these commitments are one important reason to embrace the development energy\ntechnologies, it is equally important to consider that these technologies will drive the energy", "technologies, it is equally important to consider that these technologies will drive the energy\neconomy of the future.

A government-enabled,\nprivate sector\u2013led investment has another crucial impact: it creates more secure and resilient supply\nchains. A resilient supply chain is one that proactively manages risks and recovers quickly from an\nunexpected event, or shock.\nThe long-standing U.S. approach to production, which for years, prioritized efficiency and low costs\nover security, sustainability and resilience, has resulted in increasing supply chain risk. The search for\nlow-cost production has led to geographic concentrations of key supply chains in a few nations,\nmost notably China, creating the risk of monopolistic behavior and increasing vulnerabilities for\nUnited States and its trading partners. Over the last decade, China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative has", "United States and its trading partners.

Because this framework measures supply chain risk at both the\noverall technology level and for each individual supply chain segment, SCRL provides a critical\ndiagnostic to inform where investment and policy support is required to address emerging\nbottlenecks and other energy supply chain risks.

The first subsection provides a high-level assessment of supply chain resilience\nand vulnerability across the supply chain using the standard framework. The second considers eight\nparticularly important challenges in greater detail.\n2024 Resilience and Vulnerability Assessment\nTransparency\nThe advanced batteries supply chain has limited transparency today due to challenges with data\navailability and market maturity.

Government and industry are also developing channels to facilitate communication,\nincluding the American Batteries Materials Initiative, Minerals Security Partnership, and Argonne\nNational Laboratory\u2019s Li-Bridge partnership.115\nDomestic capacity\nThe U.S. has made progress in onshoring downstream manufacturing capacity in key areas, with a\npipeline of cell manufacturing plants that could provide more than enough capacity to meet 2030\ndemand.

Finally, residual import\nreliance can be further mitigated by deepening strategic relationships with international partners and\ndiversifying international sources of supply.\nTrade concentration\nThe U.S. has significant import reliance today, particularly in upstream and midstream portions of\nthe supply chain. The PRC has significant global market share (~70\u201390 percent) for many battery-\ngrade refined minerals and engineered subcomponents, while ex-PRC options for subcomponents\nare largely concentrated in Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK).", "are largely concentrated in Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK).\n115 \u201cLi-Bridge.\u201d Argonne National Laboratory. https://www.anl.gov/li-bridge.\n-95-\nU.S. and partner countries (such as Canada, Australia, Japan, ROK, the European Union, United\nKingdom, and countries in southern Africa) are investing to diversify the supply chain and reduce\nimport dependence. Significant progress to date has been made in onshoring cell manufacturing, and\nan ex-PRC supply pipeline is also developing for upstream and midstream. To come online, projects\nmust navigate challenges discussed in the rest of this section.\nSupplier diversity\nProduction has traditionally been dominated by a smaller set of large tier-1 battery majors, with\nmany based in the PRC, Japan, and ROK.\nThe supply base is now diversifying with new entrants.

Global\nproduction of input materials is concentrated in the PRC and other countries in East Asia, and\nindividual countries still account for disproportionate shares of the global supply of critical minerals\nlike cobalt. Risks from geographic concentration are heightened by the potential for adversarial\npolicy actions, such as export restrictions.", "policy actions, such as export restrictions.\nThe developing pipeline of domestic and international projects offers an opportunity to diversify the\nsupply mix and hedge against risk. However, the formation of geographic clusters (e.g., for domestic\nbattery cell production, as discussed in the case study at the end of this Review) may create\nadditional risk from geographic concentration of operations.\nEconomic health and compliance\nU.S. manufacturers are commercially well-positioned in parts of the supply chain where they can\nbenefit from policy support, domestic resource endowments, technological advantages, or potential\nfor differentiation on quality and performance (e.g., cell, lithium, and subset of cost-advantaged or\nhigh-performance projects elsewhere).\nHowever, much of the supply chain faces challenging market headwinds relative to competitors\n(particularly established PRC firms). Key drivers include cost and IP advantages of incumbent firms,", "structural disadvantages on cost of capital and key inputs, market volatility and demand uncertainty,\nmarket immaturity and opacity, and workforce constraints, both in construction and operation of\nlarge-scale manufacturing projects.\n-96-\nChallenges in Focus\nThe U.S. has started from a position of limited domestic capacity across the steps of the supply\nchain. Early global demand for batteries and battery critical minerals, constituent materials, and\nbattery components has largely been met by foreign producers, including the PRC, which has built a\ndominant market share at key chokepoints (see Figure 4). Batteries are expected to become an\nincreasingly critical part of the energy ecosystem, making it imperative to reduce foreign reliance,\neven as the rapid growth of the sector makes doing so even more challenging. Building out a secure\ndomestic supply chain will require the U.S. to overcome several cross-cutting challenges, including:", "(a) Aggressive PRC actions to support its domestic industry\nPRC firms have a commanding market share today in many segments of the battery supply chain,\nbenefitting from decades of state-backed investment, subsidies, and incumbency in developing a\nstrong industrial base. At important chokepoints like midstream minerals processing and\nsubcomponent manufacturing, PRC firms account for roughly 70 to 90 percent of global production\ncapacity today (Figure 4), giving them significant leverage to shape market dynamics. In many parts\nof the supply chain, PRC firms have significantly increased capacity to exceed both to domestic and\neven to projected global demand,116 and the resulting oversupply has helped hold down prices and\ncrowd out potential entrants. This dynamic has already been seen in other sectors targeted as\nstrategic priorities by Chinese industrial policy, including steel, aluminum, and solar panels, with\nsimilarly damaging results for domestic industry.117", "similarly damaging results for domestic industry.117\nChina\u2019s longstanding non-market industrial policies and practices have played an important role in\nbuilding up this entrenched position. Advanced battery research and development and\nmanufacturing, including coverage of the full supply chain, has been treated as a strategic sector by\nthe PRC government, which has supported its domestic industry previously through years of\nmandatory joint ventures requirements that facilitated technology transfer and government-\napproved whitelists that explicitly preference domestic battery manufacturers. The PRC continues to\nrelease policies including with massive subsidies for consumer demand, manufacturer sales\nrequirements, favorable access to land, utilities, and other inputs, and large supplies of low-cost\ncapital (a particularly important lever to bolster competitiveness in capital-intensive battery supply\nchains, discussed in more detail in challenge (c)).", "chains, discussed in more detail in challenge (c)).\nBuilding on these subsidies, PRC firms are investing to maintain their position in the market in the\nlong term. Firms have announced plans to build production capacity that would provide 80 to 90\npercent global market share at key points in the supply chain into the 2030s.118 PRC operations are\nalso investing heavily in the next generation of advanced battery technologies (e.g., sodium-ion) and\naccount for the bulk of planned capacity buildout and deployment of these technologies today.\n116 E.g., BloombergNEF is tracking nearly 6 TWh of battery capacity announced in PRC for 2025, compared to\nestimated global demand of under 2 TWh. Though significant portions of this announced capacity may be delayed or\ncanceled, even a fraction of this pipeline of projects coming to fruition would represent a significant overbuild.

For example, concentrating\nsequential parts of the supply chain in geographic clusters helps PRC firms dramatically reduce the\ncosts associated with logistics while enabling quicker material qualification and process\nimprovement. Similarly, by co-locating with chemical plants as part of large industrial complexes,\nPRC refining and cathode manufacturing operations can secure low-cost access to reagents that may", "PRC refining and cathode manufacturing operations can secure low-cost access to reagents that may\nbe waste products of other chemical processes while more easily monetizing the waste byproducts\nof their own operations.\nConversely, midstream gaps in U.S. domestic supply chains, such as slower buildout of cathode\nprecursor and material plants, can deny domestic firms the structural advantages of colocation,\nrequiring domestically produced material to be shipped overseas for intermediate processing, and\nchallenge the business case for long-term investment.\n-98-\nPRC operations also benefit from significant investment in IP and technical knowledge amassed\nthrough years of operating at scale. U.S. companies trying to break into the market often must\npartner with foreign firms to secure IP or invest heavily in developing new IP for themselves, at\nadded cost. Limited technical experience can increase the cost of first-of-a-kind domestic projects,", "which can incur additional costs in fine-tuning and ramping production for the first time, as well as\nincrease the perceived risk of projects to potential investors.\n(c) Limited domestic resource supply\nFor some critical inputs, particularly raw materials like critical minerals, the U.S. has limited domestic\nresources available for battery manufacturing, creating a dependence on foreign sources of supply.\nIn some cases, such as nickel and cobalt, the U.S. has limited domestic mineral deposits that can be\neconomically developed. In other cases, such as natural graphite, the U.S. has large-scale mineral\ndeposits but faces lengthy development timelines to bring mining capacity online. Without\nappropriate mitigations, reliance on foreign sources of supply can create risk downstream in the\nsupply chain and to the broader economy by leaving operations vulnerable to supply shocks, both\nfrom unexpected disruptions like natural disasters and bottlenecks in global shipping and logistics,", "and from adversarial state policy, such as export controls.119 The lack of upstream resources can also\ncompound cost disadvantages in the midstream by limiting opportunities for vertical integration and\ncolocation of operations.\n(d) High capital costs for new domestic projects\nU.S. operations are especially disadvantaged by high capital costs, relative to other countries and to\nthe PRC in particular. Capital repayment can be one of the largest drivers of unit costs, particularly\nin the midstream, where projects are often at greater than $1 billion scale, and projects can be\nanywhere from two to seven times more expensive to build in the U.S. compared to the PRC and\nother countries. Higher U.S. capital costs are a result of constraints in the construction sector\n(including shortages in the trade workforce, also discussed in challenge (h)), significantly slower\ntimelines for project delivery (typically multiple years compared to 6 to 12 months), and a higher", "timelines for project delivery (typically multiple years compared to 6 to 12 months), and a higher\nbaseline cost of doing business. First-of-a-kind domestic projects are particularly exposed to these\npressures because of the unique challenges in initial project delivery and commissioning (see\nchallenge (g)).\nHigh project delivery costs are compounded further by the high return expectations of U.S.\ninvestors and the high cost of capital for many domestic project developers. Due to China\u2019s large-\nscale industrial policy support and non-market policies and practices, PRC firms can leverage cheap,\nin some cases, effectively free, capital from state-owned financial institutions and other low-cost\nproviders, allowing them to overbuild capacity relative to domestic demand and compete more\nreadily in low-price environments. In contrast, to attract private capital, U.S. projects must deliver a", "highly competitive return to investors, particularly in parts of the supply chain perceived as high-risk\nlike minerals processing, which requires higher prices for their refined and manufactured products.\nProjects that would break even on operating cost in a low-price environment can nonetheless\n119 E.g., potential risk to domestic manufacturing from PRC export controls on graphite.

Though EV sales have continued to grow, fluctuating demand in some markets has\ncreated short-term uncertainty about future need for battery materials, with a resulting impact on\nprices and project development. For some key inputs, prices have fallen by as much as 80 percent\nsince their peak in 2022, driven by uncertainty about the trajectory of the future demand ramp-up\nand mass-buildout of low-cost capacity by PRC firms.

The prospect of\nfuture volatility serves as an additional deterrent to private investors, who may now require higher\nreturns and shorter payback periods commensurate to the perceived risk of projects operating in a\nmarket with high levels of demand and price volatility, all of which make it more difficult for\ndomestic projects to attract capital.

During the period from 2021 to present, the Biden\u2013Harris Administration has\ndeployed historic new funding, authorities, and incentives to reduce supply chain risks and\nvulnerabilities. These investments in increasing resilience have enabled the nation to weather more\nrecent shocks and disruptions to critical mineral supply chains without significant impacts to the\nnational economy.\nThe 100-day Supply Chain Review and subsequent One-year Review identified three thematic areas\nfor federal investments in critical mineral supply chain resilience: (1) building capacity for domestic\nproduction of critical minerals and strengthening U.S. stockpiles, (2) fostering sustainable and\ntransparent critical mineral supply chains, including by expanding options for recycling and\nrecapture of minerals waste, as well as manufacturing scrap and end-of-life products, and promoting", "recapture of minerals waste, as well as manufacturing scrap and end-of-life products, and promoting\nhigh sustainability standards with allies and (3) identifying supply chain vulnerabilities and working\nwith industry, allies, and partners to reduce supply risk.\nThere has been historic progress since 2021 in all three of these areas, leading to increased critical\nmineral supply chain resilience.

The significant progress related to\nlabor standards and transparency of supply chains needs to be continued. Over the next four years,\nincreased threats due to export barriers or controls from other countries, as well as rapidly increasing\ndemand for critical minerals may challenge our ability to meet the needs of the clean energy\ntransition as well as national security objectives and consumer products demand.\nThree goals are outlined to reduce the risks associated with the four-year outlook: 1) increasing", "Three goals are outlined to reduce the risks associated with the four-year outlook: 1) increasing\nsustainable production of critical minerals in the United States, 2) doubling domestic recycling and\nreprocessing of critical minerals from waste or mine tailings, and 3) working with partners to\ndevelop high standard markets for critical minerals. Achieving these goals will lead to a robust and\nsustainable U.S. minerals sector that not only meets the demands of emerging technologies but also\npromotes secure access for all sectors to the essential raw materials needed for innovation and\ngrowth.\n-117-\nSECTOR OVERVIEW\nIntroduction\nMinerals are the foundation of all modern economies. Industries that rely heavily on critical\nminerals\u2014such as clean energy production, storage, and transmission; electric vehicles; aerospace;\ndefense; and electronics\u2014are essential to national security and the clean energy transition. As", "defense; and electronics\u2014are essential to national security and the clean energy transition. As\ndescribed in the Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024,135 these and other industries that use nonfuel\nmineral materials contributed $3.84 trillion to the U.S. economy in 2023136 (14 percent of U.S.\nGDP). Combined, the U.S. nonfuel mineral industry, including mining and processing of raw\nmaterials and recycling, employed approximately 1.32 million workers across all 50 States as of 2023.\nIn 2023, the U.S. was a net exporter of raw mineral materials and a net importer of processed\nmineral materials.\nThis sector focuses on minerals and materials identified as critical under the Energy Act of 2020137\nand the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act.138 The determination of criticality is a\nmechanism to monitor mineral supply chains through repeated assessments of risk and resilience,\nbased on factors that include the potential for supply chain disruption, the economic impact of", "based on factors that include the potential for supply chain disruption, the economic impact of\ndisruption, and global trade exposure. In 2023\u20132024, the imposition of a series of export controls by\nforeign producers has illustrated the vulnerability of these critical minerals\u2019 supply chains to\ndisruption through coercive action.\nEvolution of the Sector through 2020\nOver the past several decades, demand for technologies that are faster, smaller, lighter, and smarter\nhas greatly increased the need for mineral commodities. For example, today\u2019s mobile phone is a\npocket-sized, touch-sensitive, wireless computer that contains lithium and cobalt in the battery,\ntantalum in its capacitors, and germanium and gallium in the microchips. High-strength alloys such\nas aluminum-lithium have made aircraft lighter and more fuel efficient. Superalloys incorporating\ncobalt, rhenium, tantalum, and hafnium allow jet turbines to operate at higher temperatures, also", "cobalt, rhenium, tantalum, and hafnium allow jet turbines to operate at higher temperatures, also\nreducing fuel consumption. Technological innovations such as these, combined with the energy\ntransition and infrastructure reinvestment, are increasing demand for a broadening range of mineral\ncommodities.139\nModern mineral supply chains are complex and global. They run from geologic exploration through\nmining, processing, manufacturing and assembly into products, followed by recycling of waste\nmaterials and products at the end of their use. In 2020, the Energy Act provided a whole-of-\ngovernment, cross-sectoral definition of a critical mineral.

Since 2021, the\nAdministration, State, Tribal, and private sector partners have advanced the geoscience, technology,\nand policy development required to reuse mine waste and waste from energy production as a\nresource. These advancements are answering the question of how much of that waste could be used", "resource. These advancements are answering the question of how much of that waste could be used\nto strengthen critical mineral supply chains and are informing federal and private sector investments\nin waste reprocessing, environmental management, and waste site reclamation. And there have\nalready been successes: rare earth elements are being extracted from acid mine drainage at treatment\nfacilities in West Virginia (see case study below).\nCASE STUDY: EXTRACTING MINERALS FROM ACID MINE DRAINAGE\nAbandoned mines are often a source of acid mine drainage (AMD), which pollutes waterways\nand can result in the disappearance of animal life from a river or stream. However, AMD can\nalso contain rare earth elements, and recovering those offers the promise of a new source of\ncritical minerals that could also help offset the cost of expensive treatment plants.\nIn April 2024, with funding from the DOE and the DOI Office of Surface Mining Reclamation", "In April 2024, with funding from the DOE and the DOI Office of Surface Mining Reclamation\nand Enforcement, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) began\noperations at the Richard Mine AMD Treatment Facility in Monongalia County, West Virginia.\nThe facility treats AMD using a process developed by the University of West Virginia\u2019s Water\nResearch Institute that allows for the collection of light and heavy rare earth oxides before the\ncleaned drainage is released into Deckers Creek.\nThis is the second such facility built by the State of West Virginia, and it represents a significant\nstep forward in addressing the dual challenge of environmental restoration and resource\nrecovery. By reclaiming critical minerals from polluted water, the Richard Mine facility not only\nimproves local ecosystems but also contributes to the nation\u2019s clean energy supply chain.

Interagency and intergovernmental\npartnerships are bringing together existing data on abandoned mine lands. The Federal Mining\nDialogue171 and State Geological Surveys are actively working to demonstrate the on-the-ground\npotential to recover critical minerals through reprocessing mine waste.

Also under the Energy Act of 2020, the DOE released the first Critical Materials\nlist for energy using a new methodology that considered projected scenarios for clean energy\nadoption. The DoD also maintains a list of strategic and critical materials for the National Defense\nStockpile under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. Together these lists monitor\naspects of resilience and vulnerability described below and form the basis for forward-looking\nsupply chain analysis.\nIn 2024 the interagency community developed several innovations that will be incorporated into the", "In 2024 the interagency community developed several innovations that will be incorporated into the\nresilience and vulnerability assessments above, in particular developing new forward-looking supply\nchain analysis and forecasting capabilities. DOC\u2019s Industry & Analysis (I&A) unit conducted supply\nchain assessments of minerals in strategic sectors such as semiconductors and electric vehicles,\nidentifying current and potential alternative sources and policy recommendations to mitigate short-\nterm supply disruptions as well as mid-to-long term policy solutions. I&A also draws from an\ninternally developed SCALE tool, which weighs structural supply chain risks to drive policy\nrecommendations to advance supply chain resilience. USGS developed a new model to quantify the\npotential economic impacts of mineral commodity supply disruptions both to individual sectors and\nto the overall U.S. gross domestic product. Moreover, DOE conducted new Supply Chain Readiness", "to the overall U.S. gross domestic product. Moreover, DOE conducted new Supply Chain Readiness\nassessments that characterize global supply-demand balance, cost curves and economic\ncompetitiveness of the U.S. and allied operations for energy minerals.\nThese latest models and more that are in development will contribute to and support updates to the\nwhole of government List of Critical Minerals and future quadrennial reporting requirements. As\nnoted above, minerals supply chains are complex and global; thus, resilience and vulnerability must\nbe considered globally even while focusing on national interests.\nTransparency\nThe U.S. has established robust and transparent data on mineral supply chains for about 100\nminerals in 180 countries and across 236 manufacturing sectors. Over the past four years, the U.S.\nGovernment has enhanced supply chain transparency through interagency partnerships, data", "Government has enhanced supply chain transparency through interagency partnerships, data\nsharing, and agencies leveraging economic data and each other's modeling efforts. The USGS 2022\nwhole-of-government List of Critical Minerals and the DOE Critical Materials List for energy both\nfeature transparent rankings of supply risks and have provided the Administration a strong evidence\nbase for historic investments in mineral supply chains.\n-133-\nDespite this significant progress, opportunities for further transparency remain, particularly\ndownstream from the mining stage. Production data at refinery and downstream stages is reported\nless frequently, and not all countries adhere to the same reporting standards. This lack of data\nreduces transparency as materials are transformed and assembled into parts, components, and\nproducts such as cell phones, aircraft, and satellites. Agencies are committed to addressing these data\ngaps to enhance transparency and resilience across sectors.", "gaps to enhance transparency and resilience across sectors.\nDomestic capacity\nAcross the U.S., every state participates in the mineral economy and has opportunities to contribute\nto increased domestic capacity. The USGS Earth MRI program and multilateral partnerships such as\nthe CMMI and the IPEF are identifying which minerals could feasibly be mined and processed in\nthe U.S. and which minerals will require the U.S. to rely on strategic trade relationships. The Mineral\nCommodity Summaries 2024 show there is no domestic primary production for at least 14 critical\nminerals and the group of rare earth elements. There are also multiple critical mineral commodities\nfor which there is no domestic secondary (recycled) production190. The data also show that for at\nleast seven critical minerals and the group of rare earth elements, the U.S. had three or fewer\nproducers. Further downstream, progress has been made to increase capacity in key supply chains,", "producers. Further downstream, progress has been made to increase capacity in key supply chains,\nsuch as for lithium-ion batteries, neodymium iron boron magnets, and semiconductors. Current and\ntargeted investments to fill these gaps, such as for lithium,191 are expanding domestic capacity and\nare expected to improve supply chain resilience by 2030.\nTrade concentration\nTrade is extremely important to the U.S. mineral economy. In 2023, the U.S. was a net exporter of\nraw mineral materials (with exports valued at $10.6 million and imports valued at $5.9 million), and a\nnet importer of processed mineral materials (with exports valued at $101 billion and imports valued\nat $203 billion). The degree of reliance on trade and the nature of supporting trade agreements are\ncrucial determinants of risks associated with trade concentration. In 2023, there were 15 mineral\ncommodities for which the U.S. was 100-percent net import reliant and 16 additional commodities", "commodities for which the U.S. was 100-percent net import reliant and 16 additional commodities\nfor which the U.S. was more than 75-percent net import reliant. The U.S. Government is taking\nsteps to decrease risks associated with trade concentration, such as investing in domestic capacity\nand establishing strong partnerships with allies who are potential trade partners for critical minerals.\nSupplier diversity\nMineral production is highly concentrated in a few countries. Supplier diversity is very low for many\nmineral commodities at either the raw material production step, the processing step or both. When\nmineral production is concentrated in a few countries, U.S. importers have limited options. In the\nrisk assessment for the List of Critical Minerals a single point of failure in the supply chain is\n190 U.S. Geological Survey, \u201cMineral Commodity Summaries 2024\u201d, U.S. Geological Survey, 2024,\nhttps://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf", "https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf\n191 \u201cFact Sheet: Biden- Harris Administration Takes Further Action t0 Strengthen and Secure Critical Mineral Supply\nChain\u201d, The White House, September 20, 2024,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-\nreleases/2024/09/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-further-action-to-strengthen-and-secure-critical-\nmineral-supply-chains/\n-134-\nconsidered a significant risk factor. The critical minerals beryllium, nickel, and zirconium are\nproduced domestically but have a single point of failure. This lack of domestic competition creates\nopportunities for the government to take steps to fund and increase supplier diversity through\ncompetitions, regulatory approvals, or other interventions.\nAgility\nAgility varies widely across supply chains in the minerals sector. Since critical minerals are used\nglobally in almost all sectors, there is a wide range of manufacturing complexity, lead times and", "globally in almost all sectors, there is a wide range of manufacturing complexity, lead times and\nsupply chain flexibility. The NDS provides additional agility for the defense industrial base in\nresponse to a war or national emergency. More broadly, the U.S. Government is developing early\nwarning systems for priority critical minerals to increase the sector\u2019s agility.\nAt the raw material stage, the least agile critical mineral supply chains are byproduct minerals.192\nMarket incentives do not strongly influence byproduct mineral production. However, at the\nsecondary production stage, which includes recycling and recovery, current DOE investments to\ndevelop cost-competitive recycling processes193 are adding to domestic capacity to draw from\nsecondary materials. These investments particularly benefit byproduct critical minerals, which may\nbe more readily available in mine wastes than through primary production. In addition, BIL", "be more readily available in mine wastes than through primary production. In addition, BIL\ninvestments in the USGS National Mine Waste Inventory include byproduct mineral mapping,\nwhich is identifying targets for research and development and for regulatory innovation to enable\nmine waste reprocessing.194\nSecurity\nMining, refining and processing facilities are large operations with significant dependencies on\nenergy, water, and transportation infrastructure. Because mines are tied to geological ore deposits\nand therefore impossible to relocate, the raw materials portion of critical mineral supply chains has\nlow resilience to security risks. For example, there are titanium, zirconium and rare earth mineral\ndeposits located in regions prone to hurricanes. Internationally, the USGS and the DOC\u2019s I&A have\nreported on risks for tin, tungsten and tantalum mined in conflict regions on the African", "reported on risks for tin, tungsten and tantalum mined in conflict regions on the African\ncontinent.195 The critical mineral sector is vulnerable to environmental and geopolitical risks that can\ndisrupt transportation.

However, over that same period of time, federal\ninvestments and policy advances will be bearing fruit. There will be improved tools to monitor\nsupply chain health, enabling agile and targeted responses to future challenges and making supply\nchain investments more efficient and effective. There will be an increasing supply of critical minerals\nproduced domestically and by friendly nations, from both conventional sources such as new mines\nand unconventional sources such as mine waste and recycling.

The goals and priority actions below carry\non the lines of effort identified in the 100-day Supply Chain Review.\nGoal #1: Increase sustainable production of critical minerals in the United States. New\nmapping is revealing previously unknown domestic critical mineral potential both still in the ground", "and in mine waste. To capitalize on this potential, following EO 14017, the Biden Administration\nrecommended fundamental reform of the Mining Law of 1872, which governs access to mineral\nresources on hundreds of millions of acres of public land in the United States. In addition, the\nAdministration recommended improved engagement with communities and consultation with\nTribes to improve community and Tribal outcomes and reduce time consuming litigation.\nPriority action 1.1. Enact policies to modernize mining policy in the United States to achieve the best outcomes for\ncommunities and Tribes impacted by mining, America\u2019s clean energy and climate goals, and certainty for industry.\nPriority action 1.2. Accelerate mapping of the nation\u2019s domestic mineral potential; complete mapping of 50 percent of\nthe subsurface and complete the National Mine Waste Inventory for 20 states by 2028.\nPriority action 1.3. Complete a national assessment of lithium resources in the United States and implement", "investments and policies that accelerate the production and processing of lithium from domestic sources, increasing that\nproduction by a factor of four by 2028.\n-137-\nPriority action 1.4. Identify and close research gaps to provide information needed to support decision-making on\nseabed mining policy options and strengthen regulations pertaining to federal management of seabed minerals.\nGoal #2: Double domestic recycling and reprocessing of critical minerals from mine wastes,\nmanufacturing scrap, and end-of-life products. Waste streams ranging from electronics recycling\nto mine waste are a potential source of critical minerals. Rapid public- and private-sector progress is\nbeing made in quantifying this potential, and in technology and standards to facilitate its\ndevelopment. By tapping into the waste, by-products, and end-of-life products including critical\nmaterials at all stages of the supply chain, we create more domestic sources for critical minerals", "materials at all stages of the supply chain, we create more domestic sources for critical minerals\n(including some that we do not have access to at the mining step) and create more domestic\nmanufacturing opportunities.\nPriority action 2.1: Establish programs to incentivize repurposing and recycling. In particular, expand nascent\nrecycling streams that are not currently collected, such as EV batteries.\nPriority action 2.2: Leverage partnerships with States, industry and non-governmental organizations to open mine\nwaste processing operations at sites with or near significant critical mineral resources as identified in the National Mine\nWaste Inventory (priority action 1.2).\nPriority action 2.3: Pass legislation to remove unnecessary hurdles to the reprocessing of mine wastes.\nGoal #3: Work with partners to develop high standard markets for critical minerals.\nEstablishing high standards for trade in critical minerals, working in conjunction with the MSP, with", "trade partners will advance resilient, diverse, safe, equitable, transparent, and sustainable critical\nmineral supply chains.\nPriority action 3.1: Develop downstream standards requirements for a subset of critical minerals to establish the high\nstandard marketplace requirements.\nPriority action 3.2: Work with producers, existing standards bodies, and metal exchanges to promote traceability of\nproducts to ensure standards are being met at each step in the supply chain.\nLegislative and Budgetary Objectives\nIncreasing the amount of domestic mining will require increasing public trust in domestic mining\nlaws and regulations. Therefore, a significant priority is to achieve fundamental mining reforms,\nwhich would require Congress to pass legislation to significantly amend the Mining Law of 1872.\nMore moderate reforms can still improve public confidence, community outcomes, and industry\ncertainty. Excess claim maintenance fees, for example, can be redirected toward abandoned mine", "certainty. Excess claim maintenance fees, for example, can be redirected toward abandoned mine\nremediation (Priority 1.3) and community impact assistance. Tribal consultation requirements can\nensure that Tribes are meaningfully engaged prior to mining proposals moving forward.\nAdditionally, incentives can encourage positive industry actions, such as establishing benefit\nagreements with communities and Tribes, seeking free, prior, and informed consent from Tribal\nNations, and adhering to the highest global industry standards.\nGood Samaritan legislation governing liability for remediation of mine wastes has passed both\nchambers of Congress in different sessions of Congress, and if enacted could help third parties\n-138-\naddress legacy pollution from abandoned hard rock mines (Priority 1.3).

The 100-day Supply Chain Report called for increased support\nto the USGS National Minerals Information Center; the need for data collection and risk assessment\nhas grown only more acute since that report. Accordingly, the President\u2019s Budget Request for 2025\ncalls for additional investment in supply chain forecasting and scenario analysis by the USGS, in\naddition to complementary support for supply chain analysis by Commerce. In addition, specific\nstages of critical minerals supply chains require investment. For raw materials production and", "stages of critical minerals supply chains require investment. For raw materials production and\nsecondary materials reprocessing, BIL funding is accelerating, but will not complete, the USGS\nnational mapping of domestic critical mineral resources both still in the ground and in mine waste\n(Priority 1.2); and investments by DOE in recycling will require some years to grow and mature\nsecondary markets for critical minerals (Priorities 2.1 and 2.2). Similarly, one hurdle to efficient\npermitting is the lack of sufficient funding from Congress for mine permitting agencies, such as the\nDOI Bureau of Land Management or U.S. Forest Service and review agencies such as EPA.\nAdditional funding should be provided, particularly for staff with mining expertise and staff needed\nto conduct cultural resource surveys and consult with Tribes (Priority 1.1).\nLong-term Resilience Goals\nA resilient U.S. minerals economy must not only survive but thrive in the face of emerging", "A resilient U.S. minerals economy must not only survive but thrive in the face of emerging\nchallenges.

These descriptors are even more apt when one", "open, interconnected, diverse, and complex. These descriptors are even more apt when one\nconsiders that the agri-food sector is interconnected with not only animal and plant health but\nenvironmental and human health as well. The agri-food sector is foundational to the U.S. economy\nand way of life. Agriculture, food, and related industries contributed roughly $1.530 trillion to the\ngross domestic product in 2023, and in 2022 accounted for 10.4 percent of total U.S. employment,\nincluding around 2.6 million farm jobs and another 19.6 million jobs in food- and agriculture-related\nindustries.199 USDA estimates that (in 2022) each dollar of agricultural exports stimulated another\n$1.09 in business activity.200 Further, every household in the United States depends on food and\nagricultural products.\nSector Overview\nAs an identified critical sector under Executive Order 14017 on America\u2019s Supply Chains, and", "As an identified critical sector under Executive Order 14017 on America\u2019s Supply Chains, and\nNational Security Memorandum (NSM) 16 on Strengthening the Security and Resilience of United\nStates Food and Agriculture and NSM-22 on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience, the agri-\nfood supply chain plays an outsized role in impacting public health and safety as well as the U.S.\neconomy. The U.S. agriculture sector extends beyond the farm business to include a range of related\nindustries such as: food and beverage manufacturing; food and beverage stores; food services and\neating/drinking places; textiles, apparel, and leather products; and forestry and fishing. Expenditures\non food accounted for 12.9 percent of U.S. households\u2019 spending, on average, in 2023, an increase\nfrom 12.8 percent in 2022.

Vulnerabilities along any of these points of", "the agri-food supply chain create vulnerabilities for food security, public health, and the economy.\nThe agri-food supply chain is also increasingly global in scope and interconnected, as evidenced by\nthe growth in agricultural trade. With U.S. agricultural output growing faster than domestic demand\nfor many products, U.S. farmers and agricultural firms have been relying on export markets to\nsustain prices and revenues. As a result, U.S. agricultural exports have grown steadily over the past\n25 years\u2014reaching $174 billion in 2023, up from $57.3 billion in 1998. During the same period, total\nagricultural imports more than quintupled in value, reaching $195 billion in 2023. In addition, many\nagri-food products are impacted by seasonality, environmental stress, pests and diseases, and\nperishability.

Early 20th-\ncentury agriculture was labor intensive and took place on many small, diversified farms in rural areas\nwhere more than half the U.S. population lived. Agricultural production in the 21st century, on the\nother hand, is concentrated on a smaller number of large, specialized farms in rural areas where less", "than a fourth of the U.S. population lives. Innovations in animal and crop genetics, chemicals,\nequipment, and farm organization have enabled continuing output growth without adding much to\ninputs. As a result, even as the amount of land, labor, and other inputs used in farming declined,\ntotal farm output nearly tripled between 1948 and 2021.202\nThe increasing complexity of the agri-food supply chain has been necessary to sustain population\ngrowth as well as changing preferences as income levels increase.

On one hand, for example,\nsubsistence farming reduces risks against external shocks, as the entire supply chain from end to end\nis managed directly on the farm. However, this systems approach is also the most vulnerable to a\nsingle major disruption occurring at the farm-level. On the other hand, as the agri-food supply chain\ninvolves an increasing number of actors and becomes more diversified and geographically\nintegrated, it becomes more resilient to individual farm-level disruptions, but overall becomes more\nexposed and vulnerable to different types of disruptions.\nKey Sector Trends from 2021 to Present\nThe 2022 USDA Agri-Food Supply Chain Assessment: Program and Policy Options for Strengthening Resilience\nidentified key vulnerabilities impacting the agri-food supply chain in six priority areas, all of which\nremain key concerns in 2024:", "remain key concerns in 2024:\n\u2022 Concentration and Consolidation in Agri-Food Production, Manufacturing, and Distribution\n\u2022 Labor Needs\n\u2022 Ecological and Climate Risks to Crops\n\u2022 Livestock and Poultry Disease Threats\n\u2022 Transportation Bottlenecks\n\u2022 Trade Disruptions\nSince 2022, the dynamic within and across these key concerns continues to shift in conjunction with\nworld events. For example, conflict in the Red Sea starting in 2023 has resulted in significant\nadjustment of transportation routes, impacting the flow of U.S. agricultural goods to critical export\nmarkets. As another example, extreme weather events in 2024 resulted in targeted U.S. agricultural\nproduction losses and the need to invest in supply chain recovery for affected commodities.

Many of these challenges developed in relation to strengthening data and", "market intelligence in order to enhance USDA\u2019s understanding of supply chains and address\ndisruptions early.\nFirst, USDA realized the need for additional visibility on the agri-food supply chain beyond its\ntraditional end points to where it intersects with other critical sectors\u2014public health and biological\nrisks, national security, transportation, information and communications technology, and critical\nminerals. For example, agricultural exports are dependent on the freight transportation network to\nmove products from the nation\u2019s interior to export ports and ultimately to overseas markets.\nHowever, neither USDA nor FDA possess the regulatory authority to compel data collection from\ntransportation service providers that would greatly enhance market transparency for our\nstakeholders and reduce overall supply chain vulnerabilities, such as location data on ocean shipping\ncontainers.\nUnderstanding these interdependencies among different critical-sector supply chains is crucial to", "Understanding these interdependencies among different critical-sector supply chains is crucial to\nensuring the success of individual sector supply chains and requires collaboration across federal\nagencies. This was evidenced during the March 2024 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in\nBaltimore, whereby the resulting supply chain disruptions did not fit squarely into specific individual\ncritical sectors, but rather overlapped among many different supply chains, requiring a coordinated\neffort through the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force among USDA, DOT, SBA, DOE, FDA,\nCommerce, State-level agencies, and others. In addition to the need for data sharing in the face of\ndifferent incidents\u2014whether a transportation disruption or a biological threat of concern to the\nbiodefense community, there are also challenging scientific, legal, and security issues that agencies\nmust tackle together.\nSecond, many supply chain disruptions do not originate within the United States nor are they", "Second, many supply chain disruptions do not originate within the United States nor are they\nexclusive to the U.S. agri-food supply chain. USDA has identified the need for additional visibility\ninto the agri-food supply chain beyond U.S. borders, particularly with Canada and Mexico, which are\ndeeply integrated with the U.S. supply chain through proximity, shared land-borders, trade, and the\ntransportation network. Supply chain disruptions impacting these countries, such as recent labor\ndisputes, migration issues, border closures, transportation service disruptions, and other trade\ndisruptions can potentially have large ripple effects across the U.S. agri-food supply chain, and vice\nversa. Throughout these recent disruptions, there were several opportunities to develop working\nrelationships and some data sharing with Canadian and Mexican counterparts. However, more\nformal cooperation and transparency on cross-border issues is necessary for building resilience", "formal cooperation and transparency on cross-border issues is necessary for building resilience\nwithin the U.S. agri-food supply chain.\nThird, while much data sharing between USDA and the private sector is well established, there are\nemerging areas in which additional data sharing could provide greater insight and early warnings of\nsupply chain disruptions. These areas often involve data that are closely held by individual\ncompanies reluctant to lose a competitive advantage by sharing such information. Thus, no\nindividual company is incentivized to share its data, even though widespread data sharing among all\ncompanies would provide them a relative advantage on managing supply chain disruptions\n-152-\nimpacting the agri-food sector as a whole. Furthermore, clear visibility into supply chain disruptions\noften requires voluntary data sharing from the private sector to government. This approach limits its", "responsive efforts and oversight only to what is voluntarily shared, potentially creating data gaps in\nvisibility and increased vulnerability. For example, recent industry consolidation has limited the\navailability of grain price data in certain geographic regions, limiting the analytical capacity to\nmonitor and detect potential disruptions that are often signaled through such price data.\nEngagement with Industry\nOver the past four years, USDA has engaged frequently and actively with the public and impacted\nindustries. Specific examples include public requests for information related to food supply chain\nresilience as a whole; meat and poultry processing; competition in seeds, retail, and fertilizer sectors;\nand climate smart agriculture and forestry practices. USDA also conducted listening sessions with\nthe public on topics including farm labor, emerging technologies, and access to research. Additional", "industry engagements include cabinet and sub-cabinet level discussions related to acute supply chain\ndisruptions impacting the flow of agricultural goods via water and rail; distribution challenges for\nschool meal and nutrition assistance programs; and opportunities to reduce transportation\nbottlenecks to support U.S. export competitiveness.\nEngagement with Allies and Partners\nUSDA has actively engaged with partners on key supply chain concerns, especially those related to\nclimate. Most notably, in 2021, the United States, led by USDA, in partnership with the United Arab\nEmirates, launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate / AIM4C) as a\njoint initiative to address climate change and global hunger by uniting participants to significantly\nincrease investment in, and other support for, climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation\nover five years (2021\u20132025).

Finally,\nEconomic Health and Compliance indicates farm income and wealth is resilient, with many Federal\nsupport programs, but faces challenges from declining productivity\u2014linked to decreased investment\nin research and development, labor shortages, and economic shocks that continue to ripple through\nthe sector (e.g., labor and transportation disruptions leading to lost sales and lost market share for\nexports).", "exports).\nTransparency\nData Availability & Analytics, Surveillance, and Forecasting\nEconomic information and market intelligence form a critical knowledge base that provides\nresilience in anticipating and monitoring supply chain disruptions. USDA works directly with the\nagri-food sector to provide free, unbiased production, price, and sales information to assist in the\nmarketing and distribution of farm commodities. Wholesale, retail, and shipping data give farmers,\nproducers, and other agricultural businesses the information needed to evaluate market conditions,\nmake purchasing and selling decisions, and evaluate transportation costs in the face of near real-time\nchanges to the agri-food supply chain.

Market concentration\u2014measured by the share of industry sales\nheld by the largest firms\u2014has increased sharply over the last four decades in many seed, livestock,\nand food retail markets. In 2018\u201320, two seed companies accounted for 72 percent of planted corn", "and food retail markets. In 2018\u201320, two seed companies accounted for 72 percent of planted corn\nacres and 66 percent of planted soybean acres in the United States. In 2019, the four largest\nmeatpackers accounted for 85 percent of steer and heifer slaughter and 67 percent of hog slaughter.\nMost poultry farmers and livestock producers face even higher levels of concentration in the local\nmarkets in which they sell their products. In most metropolitan areas, five to six store chains\naccount for most supermarket sales.\nUSDA has conducted and published peer-reviewed analyses of concentration and competition in\nthree agribusiness sectors: crop seeds, meatpacking, and food retailing.210 Over the past several\ndecades, concentration in each of these sectors has significantly increased and been the subject of\nantitrust investigations. Findings from these analyses include:\n\u2022 Opportunities to commercialize innovations in agricultural biotechnology and stronger", "\u2022 Opportunities to commercialize innovations in agricultural biotechnology and stronger\nprotection for intellectual property rights over seed and related agricultural biotechnology\ninnovations were a major driver of seed sector consolidation. This was accompanied by\nmore private research and development investment in crop agriculture, rapid diffusion of\nimproved crop varieties to farmers, and higher farm productivity. Stronger scientific and\nmarketing links between seeds and agricultural chemicals were followed by a series of\nmergers among firms in these industries.\n\u2022 At the same time that U.S. seed markets became more concentrated, seed prices rose\nsignificantly, especially for genetically modified (GM) varieties. However, the evidence is\nmixed on whether market concentration led to higher seed prices or whether other factors\nmay have been more important determinants of seed price inflation. Between 1990 and", "may have been more important determinants of seed price inflation. Between 1990 and\n2020, the average price farmers paid for seed rose by 270 percent, compared with\ncommodity price inflation of 56 percent. For crops planted predominately with GM seed\n(corn, soybeans, and cotton) seed prices rose by an average of 463 percent. Despite their\nhigher cost, GM crop varieties brought significant productivity gains to farmers, partly\nthrough higher yield but also by lowering farm production costs as genetic traits substituted\nfor other inputs.\n\u2022 Meatpacking price \u201cspreads\u201d (the margin between what meatpackers pay farmers for live\nanimals and charge retailers for meat products) have increased significantly in beef over the\npast decade, which may reflect firms\u2019 exercising market power to raise profits. Higher price\nspreads and USDA financial support are attracting new entrants into the industry, which\ncould increase competition in the sector.", "could increase competition in the sector.\n\u2022 U.S. antitrust reviews played important roles in agri-food industry restructuring. To maintain\nmarket competition and incentives to innovate, antitrust reviews led to divestitures of some\ncompany assets in mergers involving the \u201cBig Six\u201d seed-chemical global leaders (BASF,\n210 U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, Concentration and Competition in U.S. Agribusiness, 2023.\n-165-\nBayer, Dow Agrosciences, DuPont, Monsanto, Syngenta). Merger reviews have stopped or\naltered a few meatpacking mergers, but have not been sufficient to halt consolidation in that\nindustry. Food retail mergers frequently attract antitrust scrutiny, including recent cases such\nas the merger between grocery stores Kroger and Albertsons. These enforcement actions\nhave tended to focus on mergers rather than conduct, and there has yet to be a major\nmonopolization case brought that would potential structurally separate existing food\nindustry monopolies.", "industry monopolies.\nThe food retail sector is less concentrated than livestock and poultry processing but still presents\nchallenges to supply chain resilience at the point of sale of retail food to consumers. Moreover,\nsome retail firms exercise considerable buyer power, which can affect competition and market access\nfor processors and producers up the supply chain. The top four food retailers (CR4) accounted for\n34 percent of total sales in 2019.\nIn response to these findings, USDA has prioritized investments to expand the middle of the supply\nchain and strengthen local and regional food systems to build agri-food supply chain resilience.\nThese investments to expand the middle of the supply chain will provide more options for both\nproducers and consumers and make the food system more resilient and less reliant on limited\noptions. USDA has also published new rules to foster fairer and more competitive markets and\nincreased enforcement coordination with the Department of Justice.", "increased enforcement coordination with the Department of Justice.\nAgility\nManufacturing Complexity and Lead Time\nConventional agricultural production has limited flexibility in adapting to supply and demand\nshocks. Switching agricultural production from one commodity to another requires a long lead time,\ntypically months to years, depending on the production cycle of the specific crop or livestock.\nAgricultural production and marketing cycles are fixed periods determined by the time between\nwhen a crop is planted or a live animal is born until a product is marketed. This process requires\nadvanced planning and often significant investment in specialized equipment and infrastructure. The\nproduction cycle is dependent on fixed factors, such as sufficient temperature, sunlight, and\nirrigation conditions, and the application of specialized inputs, such as seed and fertilizer for crops\nand feed for livestock, at specific intervals of the production cycle as well as continuous monitoring", "and treatment for disease and pest threats. Thus, the conventional agricultural sector cannot quickly\nramp up production to meet short-term needs. However, releasing crops from storage, substitution\nbetween similar crops/livestock, and \u201cimports\u201d (whether from other States or foreign countries) can\nprovide flexibility in the short term while production cycles adjust to new supply and demand\ncharacteristics over the longer-term. Additionally, significant research development, and\ncommercialization advances in Controlled Environment Agriculture, biotechnology, and\nbiomanufacturing of food and ingredients are expected to complement conventional production\npractices and contribute to year-round production that enhances nutrition security.\nThe USDA Science and Research Strategy 2023\u20132026 supports research on biotechnology and\nbiomanufacturing capacity in food and agriculture to reach the bold societal goals for advancing the", "U.S. bioeconomy to support a sustainable circular economy.

These systemic shocks\ninclude drought, flooding, border-crossing slowdowns, and labor disruptions, as well as localized\nfailures resulting from infrastructure degradation or damage.\nDrought in the Mississippi River watershed in fall 2022 and fall 2023 led to a reduction in the ability\nto ship corn and soybeans via barge on the river. Because barge transportation is the most\neconomical mode of transportation for long-distance shipments, a bottleneck that disrupts barge\nshipping can potentially result in higher shipping costs for grain exporters.

This has led to a situation in which half", "of farm households had negative farm income and 84 percent of farm families obtain the majority of\ntheir income from off the farm. That leaves small and mid-sized farms behind, weakens local rural\neconomies, and threatens our food security and safety.\nThese market factors have led to bigger farms and fewer farmers and a general message for both\nfarmers and food processors, that to succeed, a business needs to either get bigger or get out of the\nmarket. Since January 1981, the U.S. has lost nearly 545,000 farms and 155.6 million acres of\nfarmland. That number of farms is equivalent to the loss of every farm in North Dakota, Minnesota,\nWisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Colorado in 2023. This consolidation\nmeans more potential bottlenecks and more risk of disruption in the agri-food supply chain.\nTo build long term resilience, a distributed and resilient food system needs to make economic sense.", "Continued investments in diversifying farmer income including through creating opportunities in\ncarbon markets and the bioeconomy; building strong and flexible supplier relationships in local and\nregional food systems; maintaining stable and reliable global markets; addressing labor needs; and\ninvesting intentionally in transportation infrastructure are all necessary to support long term supply\nchain resilience in this sector.\nConclusion\nThe agri-food sector is vital to the economic stability, national security, and public health and safety\nof the United States. As this sector continues to experience transformative change through an\nincreasingly complex supply chain which touches on other critical sectors, USDA will work closely\nwith other Federal agencies, with State, local, tribal and territorial governments, and with the private\nsector to address vulnerabilities and strengthen the resilience of our agri-food supply chain.

The\nfollowing represents HHS's initial assessment for this sector to provide insights into the vulnerability\nand resilience of the public health and biological preparedness industrial base, as well as to facilitate\npartnerships across the U.S. Government and private industry toward resilient supply chain actions.\nSome assessment criteria are supplemented by DOC\u2019s 2024 SCALE supply chain risk tool which\nestimates risk factors of sector-specific industries as categorized by The North American Industry", "estimates risk factors of sector-specific industries as categorized by The North American Industry\nClassification System (NAICS; see Appendix Table 1 for inclusion criteria). Scores are derived from\ndozens of inputs and data sets that feed into three factors: vulnerability, the exposure of an industry\nto disruption; resiliency risk, the difficulty an industry faces in responding to disruption; and\ncriticality, the significance of the industry to the national economy, national security, and public\nhealth and safety of the American people.263 SCALE analysis found that five out of thirteen health-\nrelated industries were identified at high risk, suggesting that the industrial base is vulnerable to\nsupply chain disruptions.264,265,266 Further, SCALE data identified multiple health-related industries as\nmoderately critical to the national economy. Over the following pages, HHS analyzes these findings\nthrough various elements of resilience and vulnerability.\nVisibility", "through various elements of resilience and vulnerability.\nVisibility\nMuch of the data on the medical product supply chain are proprietary (e.g., confidential commercial\nor trade secret information), resulting in limited end-to-end medical product insights for government\nor industry.

For instance, the SNS had very limited supply chain data and visibility, as its\nrole had not been required under mission operating assumptions. Further, while the FDA has\nmonitored and managed drug shortages, some products (such as PPE, raw materials, and other\ninputs) have historically had little ongoing monitoring or visibility at the Federal level.267\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, industry engagement and willingness to share data created\nopportunities to build visibility into the medical product supply chains through collaborations with\nFDA and ASPR\u2014and in some cases this collaboration has continued or even expanded.

Stockpiling and inventories, as well as flexible manufacturing, are critical to\nensuring that medical product supply chains are able to respond quickly to public health\nemergencies. The U.S. continues to prepare for public health emergencies through procurement and\nstockpiling of supplies, medicines, and devices for lifesaving care. For example, the SNS procures\nand stores products that are not supported by the commercial market and commercially available\nproducts that may experience increased demand during times of emergency, as well as helps facilitate\ntheir distribution when not available through commercial channels.

As a result, commercially\navailable products may not exist in necessary quantities or be positioned for rapid distribution and\nuse during public health emergencies. Despite these challenges, HHS can move medical personnel,\nequipment, and supplies across the nation within hours.

The majority of COVID-19 tests were contracted or purchased through a U.S.\ncompany.\nOverall, the total value of the SNS inventory grew by approximately 50 percent during the COVID-\n19 response, in large part due to the procurement of PPE and ventilators using COVID-19\nsupplemental funds. However, products procured during the COVID-19 response have begun to\nexpire. Without an increase in SNS\u2019s annual appropriation, the SNS will be unable to continue to\nreplace expiring products, which will reduce holdings and the agility of the PPE supply chain.\nThe testing and diagnostics domain may have challenges to quickly ramp up production, if needed,", "The testing and diagnostics domain may have challenges to quickly ramp up production, if needed,\nfor several reasons. First, the market for over-the-counter COVID-19 or influenza tests is relatively\nnew and therefore unstable, and manufacturers lack the agility to throttle manufacturing rates in\nresponse to market demand, specifically at the consumer level. Also, there are fewer manufacturers\nsince the end of the pandemic. Additionally, novel agents or new biological threats would not be\ndetectable by existing point-of-care or over-the-counter technology. The timeline for the\ndevelopment, regulatory review, and manufacturing ramp up for a test against a novel agent remains\ntoo long to be immediately effective. While there are clinical trial risks for higher complexity tests\nsuch as laboratory or point-of-care devices such as nucleic-acid amplification tests, there are\ncurrently no federal government requirements to maintain the diagnostic materials or raw materials", "currently no federal government requirements to maintain the diagnostic materials or raw materials\nused in the manufacturing of tests.

The reliability and resilience of the pharmaceutical supply", "chains have been influenced by factors that include: (1) increasing reliance on foreign countries to\nmanufacture the medicines, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and their key starting materials; (2)\nglobal supply chains and complex production, distribution, purchasing, and contracting systems; (3)\nmarket factors such as cost pressures and market concentration that decrease diversification,\nredundancy and investments in newer quality systems or increased capacity. These factors play a\nmajor role in the generics market where profit margins are often low. Moreover, the concentration\nof power in a few dominant distributors, intermediaries, and manufacturers can create recursive\nincentives toward more consolidation in other parts of the system.\nFor generic drugs, market participants throughout the supply chains lack appropriate incentives to\nadopt practices that foster resiliency, such as diversification, redundancy, and investment in newer", "technology and mature quality systems. As a result, market participants frequently compete based on\nlowest price rather than resiliency. Concentration in pharmaceutical purchasing and distribution\nplays a role in these trends, however the individual contribution is unclear. Concentration among\norganizations that facilitate pharmaceutical purchasing contracts for generic drugs creates\nnegotiating power for intermediaries, which has generally been used to drive lower cost for\npurchasers such as hospitals and retail pharmacies, resulting in lower margins for manufacturers.\nThis concentration gives the most negotiating power to intermediaries (e.g., Group Purchasing\nOrganizations (GPOs), Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), and wholesalers), which some argue\nhave applied strong downward price pressures to generic drugs through harmful contracting\npractices, including low-price clauses that allow middlemen to unilaterally walk away from a contract", "if they find a lower price from another manufacturer.307 For some pharmaceuticals, wholesalers\nnegotiate drug acquisition costs, set drug sales prices to pharmacies, charge fees based on list prices,\nand compete in specialty drug distribution.308 Researchers and others have expressed concerns that\nconcentration among GPOs309 and PBMs310 may be undermining price competition and limiting\nhospital access to medical products.311,312 In addition, manufacturers and purchasers such as\nhospitals, pharmacies, and others, express a lack of understanding around GPO and PBM\n307 U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Utilizing demand-side incentives to encourage the private\nsector to compete not just on price but also on strengthening supply chain resilience is critical. The\nU.S. and allied countries also face challenges in drug manufacturing from foreign competition. While\nself-sufficiency across all drug products is not necessary, increasing domestic production of certain\nproducts and manufacturing technologies is crucial. For example, there is an opportunity to use end-\nto-end continuous manufacturing to reduce the number of drug shortages and increase or maintain\ndrug quality, while keeping the domestic industrial base competitive. There are also a variety of\nnovel analytical and drug production technologies that may be utilized, including portable and\nmodular manufacturing platforms (e.g., pharmaceuticals on demand), and using 3D-printing\ntechnologies for solid dosage forms. These investments, along with increasing the competitiveness", "technologies for solid dosage forms. These investments, along with increasing the competitiveness\nof the U.S. workforce through human capital investments, will work to strengthen and improve\nsupply chain resilience.\nLegislative and Budgetary Objectives\nMany causes of disruptions are unpredictable or occur at nodes in the supply chain where HHS may\nhave limited visibility, resources, or authority. Current budget authority is not sufficient to sustain\ncertain HHS activities, many of which were supported by COVID-19 supplemental funding. In\nmany cases, especially for acute responses, engagement from other HHS and U.S. Government\npartners, industry, and external stakeholders is critical for an effective response, and some\ncapabilities such as funding to purchase licenses to access proprietary market data or to build and\nmaintain existing data platforms require sustained funding or new authorities to continue. HHS has", "maintain existing data platforms require sustained funding or new authorities to continue. HHS has\nproposed a number of complementary legislative initiatives to improve the Department\u2019s capabilities\nin achieving the stated priorities. For example, the April 2024 HHS White Paper describes policy\nconcepts that would require Congressional action to develop and implement two programs, a\n-241-\nManufacturer Resiliency Assessment Program and a Hospital Resilient Supply Program. These\nprograms would provide increased payment to hospitals that take steps to identify and reduce risks\nin their supply chains such as by contracting with more reliable suppliers, diversifying their supply\nchains, and holding buffer inventories. Additional details regarding resources and other legislative\nefforts that would support HHS actions are detailed in the forthcoming draft HHS Action Plan. HHS\nwill continue to develop and make recommendations to Congress seeking statutory authorization", "will continue to develop and make recommendations to Congress seeking statutory authorization\nand funding to increase HHS\u2019s ability to collect and share information, as well as to expand its\npredictive and surveillance capacity to enhance visibility into the supply chains.\nLong-term Resilience Goals\nThe pharmaceutical and API supply chains are complex, global, and vulnerable to disruptions.\nBuilding resilient supply chains requires the U.S. Government to undertake a comprehensive,\nmultifaceted approach to induce sustained enhancements that drive resilience throughout the entire\nsupply chain. This will require sustained and active engagement from the private sector, including\npurchasers, intermediaries, and manufacturers, as well as the public sector, including Congress.\nLong-term solutions to address the reliability of the pharmaceutical and API supply chains will in\nturn contribute towards improving patient health and wellbeing by increasing access to essential", "turn contribute towards improving patient health and wellbeing by increasing access to essential\npharmaceuticals by reducing the impact of shortages and supply chain disruptions.\nConclusion\nFrequent supply chain disruptions have highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the U.S.\npharmaceutical and API supply chains, and historic efforts were made to mitigate and resolve the\nresulting disruptions and shortages. The assessment in this Review revealed that while the U.S.\nGovernment has taken notable strides to address vulnerabilities and disruptions to these supply\nchains, more needs to be done to increase the resilience of these supply chains. HHS will continue\nto invest in technology and infrastructure development to improve insights into these supply chains\nand increase the domestic capacity to produce pharmaceuticals and APIs used for a variety of\nessential medicines. HHS remains committed to increasing its capacity to identify risks and", "essential medicines. HHS remains committed to increasing its capacity to identify risks and\nvulnerabilities, strengthening the response to shortages and supply chain disruptions, building more\nresilient public health supply chains by incentivizing investments in resilient practices, and improving\ncommunication and coordination within government and with key external partners. Achieving\nthese goals requires significant funding and resources, as well as continued efforts across the U.S.\nGovernment, the private-sector, and other stakeholders, and must remain a priority to protect the\nnation\u2019s public health and increase the economic sustainability and competitiveness of the nation as\na whole.\n-242-\nAPPENDICES\nAppendix A.

Natural disasters, geopolitical\nchallenges, and the COVID-19 pandemic have created a strong impetus for ICT companies, as well\nas the federal government, to increase global ICT supply chain resilience through a variety of means.\nU.S. ICT infrastructure is highly complex, including both physical and cyber infrastructure. The\ngeographic concentration of ICT component manufacturing in Asia continues to pose significant\nrisks to global ICT supply chains and U.S. ICT infrastructure. In addition, vertical specialization and", "industry consolidation have led to single-source supplier concentration risks. While the United States\nremains the leader in design and innovation for the ICT sector, China dominates manufacturing,\nalthough some specialized components that require more advanced technical processes are produced\nin other regions.\nSince 2021, ICT companies have prioritized supply chain resilience in response to global disruptions,\ncybersecurity risks, and changing geopolitical dynamics. On the transmission side of the ICT\nindustry, the terrestrial U.S. communication infrastructure remains resilient against physical and\ncyberattacks. The submarine U.S. communication infrastructure has a similar resilience posture, but\nfaces additional challenges from competition with other industries and regulatory burdens. On the\nsoftware side, secure development practices help to reduce risk, while hardware manufacturers\ncontinue to address the heavy geographic concentration of component suppliers.", "continue to address the heavy geographic concentration of component suppliers.\nThe U.S. Government also made significant strides building ICT resilience. Key initiatives have\nbolstered U.S. semiconductor manufacturing ($52.7 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act) and\nexpanded high-speed internet access ($42.5 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law), while\nplacing a renewed emphasis on software security. Furthermore, the U.S. Government has increased\nits capacity to assess and diagnose supply chain risks across critical sectors by leveraging the risk\nmanagement and analytics forecasting expertise housed within the respective supply chain centers\nthat have been established within the Departments of Commerce and Homeland Security.\nThe United States may need further proactive measures to strengthen key ICT sectors. By investing\nin critical sectors, easing certain regulations, and collaborating with allies, the United States can", "increase its supply chain resilience across the ICT industrial base. Examples of specific priorities\ninclude bolstering the U.S. printed circuit board industry, addressing the non-market policies and\npractices that China deploys to support its manufacturing base, and continuing to work toward\nimplementation of the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC), Executive Order 14028\n(\u201cImproving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity\u201d), and National Security Memorandum 22 on Critical\nInfrastructure Security and Resilience.\nThe U.S. Government can further strengthen ICT supply chains by examining market and resilience\nissues through vehicles such as Executive Orders, and developing policies and best practices that\npromote resilience, through the use of attestation tools, bills of materials, and initiatives such as\nCISA\u2019s Secure by Design.\n-248-\nSECTOR OVERVIEW\nIntroduction\nCore networks within the U.S. communications infrastructure are vital to maintaining internet", "Core networks within the U.S. communications infrastructure are vital to maintaining internet\nfunctionality and connectivity across regions and internationally.

Low manufacturing\nprofit margins and the need for mass production drove ICT manufacturing to Asia over the\nprevious decades, and favorable attributes such as lower labor costs, subsidies, infrastructure\nbenefits, and availability of capital and land attracted high volume, consumer product electronics\nmanufacturing service (EMS) assembly to China.", "manufacturing service (EMS) assembly to China.\nVertical specialization and industry consolidation has further led to supplier single-source\nconcentration, which is also typically centered in Asia. Given that any one product may contain\nthousands of components, economies of scale are created when an ICT manufacturer can mass\nproduce and specialize in one component. Today, many of these components are manufactured in\nAsia, and in particular China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan. Production of low-value\ncomponents followed assembly to China, as low-value component producers were urged to provide\njust-in-time product and low-cost delivery to the assembly plants.\nOverview of ICT Transmission\nU.S. communications infrastructure is a complex collection of networks comprised of both physical\ninfrastructure such as buildings; networking components; fiber; satellites; towers; antennas; and", "infrastructure such as buildings; networking components; fiber; satellites; towers; antennas; and\ncyber infrastructure, including routing and switching software, operational support systems, and user\napplications. Communications networks are owned and operated by service providers in three main\nfunctional areas: services and applications, core networks, and access networks. Of these three main\nfunctional areas, the core networks are the most critical and essential for internet functionality.416\nThe core networks\u2014in both their terrestrial and submarine varieties\u2014transport a high volume of\ninternet traffic over substantial distances and/or between different service providers or carriers.\nThese networks connect U.S. regions by maintaining data centers and internet exchange facilities\n(IXFs) and using land-based fiber, coaxial cable networks, and submarine fiber optic cable systems\nto connect to international networks.", "to connect to international networks.\n416 \u201cCybersecurity: Internet Architecture is Considered Resilient, but Federal Agencies Continue to Address Risks,\u201d U.S.\nGovernment Accountability Office, published March 3, 2022, https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104560.\n-254-\nEvolution of the Sector through 2020\nWhile the United States remains the leader in the design and innovation for the ICT sector, China\nleads in manufacturing.417 Over the previous three decades, the U.S. private sector ceded\nmanufacturing of much of the ICT supply chain to Asia, and the U.S. ICT industry evolved from\nbeing vertically integrated to one that is highly outsourced. For example, beginning in the 1980s,\noriginal equipment manufacturers (OEMs) pulled back from designing and manufacturing their own\ncomputer chips and software and began outsourcing manufacturing and software development to\nspecialized technology companies. As a result, OEMs were able to focus on design and innovation", "specialized technology companies. As a result, OEMs were able to focus on design and innovation\nof new and improved technologies, making the United States the world\u2019s leader in technology\ninnovation, but at the cost of increasing reliance for hardware manufacturing on other countries.\nIn the 1990s, as ICT OEMs divested their manufacturing operations, contract manufacturing\ncompanies acquired these production facilities and consolidated the market. They began offering a\ncomprehensive range of production services, including specialized design and manufacturing for\nboth components and software.418 As of 2020, 43 percent of the electronics assembly market was\noutsourced to contract manufacturers. The remainder was assembled by OEMs for their brand\nproducts.419\nOver time, this vertical specialization and segmentation of the ICT industrial base has led to\ngeographic specialization whereby certain products and services are sourced from single regions or", "geographic specialization whereby certain products and services are sourced from single regions or\ncountries,420 and due to economies of scale, an ICT manufacturer may mass produce and specialize\nin one component. Today, although most manufacturing occurs in Asia, some specialized\ncomponents that require more advanced technical processes are still produced outside of Asia.\nKey Sector Trends from 2021 to Present\nSince 2021, ICT companies have prioritized supply chain resilience in response to global disruptions,\ncybersecurity risks, and changing geopolitical dynamics. Key trends include shifting to onshoring,\nnearshoring, and regional diversification to reduce reliance on distant suppliers, inventory\nmanagement, along with investing in real-time monitoring and supplier transparency. All these\nefforts take time, but the shift is underway. The key trends include:\nProactive Risk Classification: ICT companies may continue to refine their supply chain risk", "Proactive Risk Classification: ICT companies may continue to refine their supply chain risk\nmanagement approach given the financial burden experienced as a result of supply disruptions\nduring the pandemic.

After\nmapping upstream suppliers, purchasers of ICT products must also be aware of the production\nlocations and financial stability of each participant in the value chain that supplies a critical\ncomponent or constitutes a potential logistical bottleneck.\nBroaden Supplier Network and Regional Footprint: To eliminate and reduce the risk of single\nsource for raw materials or critical product components when possible, companies can increase", "source for raw materials or critical product components when possible, companies can increase\nresiliency and redundancy in their networks by dual-sourcing supply from multiple or lower-risk\nregions.\nPotential Development of Standardized Mapping and Other Illumination Tools: While there\nis a strong consensus about the need to more effectively map the locations of sub-tier suppliers and\nto identify upstream logistical bottlenecks, currently there is no standard methodology for doing so.\nThe ICT sectors may thus benefit from the development of standardized approaches to supply chain\nmapping that would place appropriate focus on sub-tier suppliers or logistical bottlenecks that are\nmost critical; would care for legitimate vendor concerns about being pressed to provide proprietary\ninformation; and would settle on common formats for providing maps and other information.\nWork to Shift the Optimal Amounts of Inventory Held: Many ICT manufacturers try to", "Work to Shift the Optimal Amounts of Inventory Held: Many ICT manufacturers try to\nminimize their inventory of components, thereby holding down costs by keeping stockpile\ninventories low and delivering goods as needed. This is the opposite of the \u201cjust in case\u201d\nmethodology that calls for holding more inventory in reserve. ICT companies may want to\nexplore holding more buffer inventories and also working with their suppliers to hold\ninventory at their warehouses, through a Vendor Managed Inventory system. Furthermore,\nICT manufacturers should continue to ensure that they utilize meaningful metrics, such as\norders delivered complete, accurate, and on-time, as well as time-related metrics like days of\ninventory and cycle time.\nPlan Alternatives in Logistics and Transportation: During an adverse event, almost every mode\nof transportation can be affected. To reduce the impacts of transportation and logistics issues, ICT", "companies can engage in scenario planning for different types of events and map out the alternatives\nthat can allow for the supply chain to be restored as efficiently as possible. To further assist in these\nefforts, companies can utilize technology platforms that provide real-time, blockchain visibility into\navailable logistics capacity. Companies can also study logistics patterns to help identify alternative\nproviders for each key route.\n-256-\nPROGRESS TO DATE\nOne-year Review Priorities\nThe One-year Review of the ICT Industry included specific recommendations to strengthen supply\nchain resiliency.

China currently\ndominates these markets, posing a significant risk to the U.S. supply chain. Domestic sourcing is\nconstrained by long permitting processes and environmental regulations that slow down the\ndevelopment of new mining operations and battery manufacturing plants. The CHIPS Act and BIL\noffer some funding to boost domestic production, but additional incentives and expedited\npermitting processes should be considered by Congress.

This can create supply chain vulnerabilities, as disruptions at any of these large suppliers can\nimpact the entire sector. Expanding contracts for smaller aerospace firms could also promote\nsupplier diversity. However, ensuring quality and compliance across a more diverse supplier base will\nrequire certification of new suppliers through technical assistance programs to support smaller firms\nthrough the certification process.

The U.S. Government now has an opportunity to address\nthose challenges, including increasing our production capacity and strengthening our supply chains.\nBuilding off the NDS, the Defense Department released the first National Defense Industrial\nStrategy (NDIS) in January 2024. The NDIS articulates the bold vision and associated priorities over\nthe next three to five years to achieve a defense industrial ecosystem that is \u201cdynamic, responsive,\nstate-of-the art, resilient, and a deterrent to our adversaries.\u201d The NDIS outlines the vision for\nensuring the Department can continue this support and produce at a pace and scale needed to meet", "ensuring the Department can continue this support and produce at a pace and scale needed to meet\nthe ever-growing demands we face now and into the future.\nIt is important to note that some of the work was already in progress prior to the NDIS release.\nOver the last four years, the Department has been working to get better supply chain visibility in\ncritical areas, while ensuring that we work better with industry to achieve our national security goals.\nWhile the current state of the industrial base has some visible challenges the FY2025 NDIS\nImplementation Plan (NDIS-IP) details the ongoing and planned actions taken by DoD to achieve\nthe vision set forth in the NDIS and to address key challenges to the U.S. industrial base.

The DIB is part of the global supply chain\nand faces unique challenges, including long lead times, an insufficient workforce, geopolitical shocks\n(such as the global pandemic and the Russian Federation\u2019s invasion of Ukraine), and a focus on\nefficiency over resilience in production and fulfillment (e.g., \u201cjust-in-time management\u201d).", "efficiency over resilience in production and fulfillment (e.g., \u201cjust-in-time management\u201d).\nFurthermore, the DIB faces other unique challenges, including inadequate domestic production,\nsmall or erratic demand, over-customization, lack of adequate data, and obsolescence. The National\nDefense Strategy (NDS) states that building a resilient ecosystem is vital to national defense.\nA robust and resilient industrial base provides the enduring foundation for military advantage. While\nAmerica continues to generate the world\u2019s most capable weapons systems, it must have the capacity\nto produce those capabilities at speed and scale to maximize our advantage. Accordingly, the 2022\nNDS prioritizes strengthening the industrial base to \u201censure that we produce and sustain the full\nrange of capabilities needed to give U.S., allied, and partner forces a competitive advantage.\u201d Doing\nso builds on lessons learned in recent decades and the enduring advantage of the global international", "economic order, which has proven to be a major strength for the U.S. and our allies.

Most notably, the traditional\nDIB consolidated in the wake of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s meeting with major prime contractors\nand their suppliers in 1993 at what became known as the \u201cLast Supper.\u201d\nToday the U.S. needs to shift from policies rooted in the 20th century that supported a narrow\ndefense industrial base, capitalized on the DoD as the monopsony power, and promoted either/or\ntradeoffs among cost, speed, and scale. Instead, the U.S. must build a modernized industrial", "tradeoffs among cost, speed, and scale.

As we build a modernized industrial ecosystem, we\nremain mindful of the environment in which private industry operates and look to work with them\nto tackle adverse impacts which can manifest during change and modernization.\nAccordingly, building a more robust, modernized defense industrial ecosystem will require a\ndynamic effort across the U.S. Government to create the legal and policy conditions that allow new", "dynamic effort across the U.S. Government to create the legal and policy conditions that allow new\nentrants into the defense production and services community. We must solicit entrants of all types:\nlarge and small, domestic, and foreign, and those with no previous relationship to the DoD or\ndefense production. This will require reinvigoration and the development of new dialogues and\nrelationships. The DoD must consider the impact of government policies and decisions on industry,\njust as its adherents must appreciate their critical role in providing for the defense of the nation and\nconsider the impact of their business practices on national security.\n-355-\nCritical Sectors of the Defense Industrial Base\nGiven the breadth and scale of defense supply chains, this Review highlights four of five sectors in\nwhich critical vulnerabilities post the most pressing threat to national security.

The resilience and adaptability of prime contractors\nand sub-tier suppliers are key to this defense-unique private sector of the economy. Current efforts\nfocus on addressing critical vulnerabilities in supply chains for both existing programs and future\nrequirements, such as hypersonic weapons.

There are advances in technology that can be integrated into our systems and\ninto our DIB. Just as new system technologies require an acceptance of cost and schedule risk to\nmeet higher performance goals, the DoD must find ways of encouraging modernization and\n-356-\ninnovation in production, despite short-term effects in cost and schedule.

Currently, the health of sub-tier suppliers, manufacturing\ncapacity, and lack of visibility into our critical supply chains create unique challenges that must be\naddressed to meet national security objectives. This is a particularly acute issue for small businesses\nwho face various obstacles in helping DoD meet its challenges. Unreliable cash flow to small\nbusinesses makes the DIB more fragile and less secure, and this is driven by a range of issues from", "businesses makes the DIB more fragile and less secure, and this is driven by a range of issues from\nappropriation delays to commonly used contracting practices. Regulations and business practices can\nbe difficult to understand, costly to implement, and in a myriad of ways often create barriers to\ndoing business with DoD. Some of these barriers include confusing points of entry into defense\nmarkets, improper bundling and consolidation of contracts, and convoluted regulations. These\nbarriers strain the relationship between the DoD and small businesses. By working with both large\nand small businesses and more strategically utilizing the OIB, the DoD will achieve a more resilient,\nmodernized industrial ecosystem that is economically and environmentally sustainable, receives\npredictable demand signals, and does not depend on adversarial foreign sources of capital,\ntechnology, raw materials, and critical inputs.\n-370-\nPRIORITIES AHEAD\nFour-year Outlook", "technology, raw materials, and critical inputs.\n-370-\nPRIORITIES AHEAD\nFour-year Outlook\nWhile outlining a strategy is key, implementation is essential for mission success. The DoD aims to\nincentivize the development of a modernized, resilient defense industrial ecosystem that has resilient\nsupply chains, a ready workforce, taps into the Department\u2019s flexible acquisition policies, and\npromotes economic deterrence for the United States and her close allies. After engagement and\nstudy with key players in the U.S. industrial base, including both traditional and non-traditional\ncompanies, Department leadership determined that the following six initiatives needed senior\nleadership\u2019s focused attention.
