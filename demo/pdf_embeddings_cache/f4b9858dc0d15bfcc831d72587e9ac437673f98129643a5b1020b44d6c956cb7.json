Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) is the 40th report in an annual\nseries that highlights significant foreign barriers to U.S. exports, U.S. foreign direct investment, and U.S.\nelectronic commerce. This document is a companion piece to the President\u2019s 2025 Trade Policy Agenda\nand 2024 Annual Report, published by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on\nFebruary 28, 2025.\nIn accordance with Section 181 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by Section 303 of the Trade and\nTariff Act of 1984 and amended by Section 1304 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988,", "Section 311 of the Uruguay Round Trade Agreements Act, and Section 1202 of the Internet Tax Freedom\nAct, USTR is required to submit to the President, the Senate Finance Committee, and appropriate\ncommittees in the House of Representatives, an annual report on significant foreign trade barriers. The\nstatute requires an inventory from the previous calendar year of the most important foreign barriers affecting\nU.S. exports of goods and services, including agricultural commodities and U.S. intellectual property;\nforeign direct investment by U.S. persons, especially if such investment has implications for trade in goods\nor services; and U.S. electronic commerce. Such an inventory enhances awareness of these trade\nrestrictions, facilitates U.S. negotiations aimed at reducing or eliminating these barriers, and is a valuable\ntool in enforcing U.S. trade laws and promoting U.S. economic and security interests.", "tool in enforcing U.S. trade laws and promoting U.S. economic and security interests.\nThe NTE Report is based upon information compiled within USTR, the U.S. Departments of Commerce\nand Agriculture, and other U.S. Government agencies, as well as U.S. embassies and supplemented with\ninformation provided in response to a notice published in the Federal Register, and by the trade advisory\ncommittees.\nThis Report discusses the largest export markets for the United States, covering nearly 60 trading partners.\nOmission of particular trading partners and barriers does not imply that they are not of concern to the United\nStates.\nTrade barriers elude fixed definitions, but may be broadly defined as government laws, regulations, policies,\nor practices\u2014including non-market policies and practices\u2014that distort or undermine fair competition.\nThese include measures that protect domestic goods and services from foreign competition, artificially", "stimulate exports of particular domestic goods and services, or fail to provide adequate and effective\nprotection of intellectual property rights. Non-market policies and practices, such as targeting of industrial\nsectors for dominance, non-market excess capacity, and distorting activities of state-owned or state-\nsponsored firms, may create economic and national security risks and undermine U.S. competitiveness.\nThe purpose of the NTE Report is to identify barriers the U.S. Government seeks to remove.\nThe NTE Report classifies foreign trade barriers in 14 categories. These categories cover measures and\npolicies that restrict, prevent, or impede the international exchange of goods and services, U.S. foreign\ndirect investment, or U.S. electronic commerce. The categories covered include:\n\u2022 Import policies (e.g., tariffs and other import charges, quantitative restrictions, import licensing,\ncustoms barriers and shortcomings in trade facilitation, and other market access barriers);", "customs barriers and shortcomings in trade facilitation, and other market access barriers);\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 1\n\u2022 Technical barriers to trade (e.g., unnecessarily trade restrictive standards, conformity assessment\nprocedures, or technical regulations, including unnecessary or discriminatory technical regulations\nor standards for telecommunications products);\n\u2022 Sanitary and phytosanitary measures (e.g., measures that unnecessarily restrict trade without\nfurthering safety objectives because they are applied beyond the extent necessary to protect human,\nanimal, or plant life or health, not based on science, or maintained without sufficient scientific\nevidence);\n\u2022 Government procurement (e.g., \u201cbuy national\u201d policies and closed bidding);\n\u2022 Intellectual property protection (e.g., inadequate patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark\nregimes and inadequate enforcement of intellectual property rights);", "regimes and inadequate enforcement of intellectual property rights);\n\u2022 Services barriers (e.g., prohibitions or restrictions on foreign participation in the market,\ndiscriminatory licensing requirements or regulatory standards, local-presence requirements, and\nunreasonable restrictions on what services may be offered);\n\u2022 Electronic commerce / digital trade barriers (e.g., barriers to cross-border data flows, discriminatory\npractices affecting trade in digital products, restrictions on the provision of Internet-enabled\nservices, and other restrictive technology requirements);\n\u2022 Investment barriers (e.g., limitations on foreign equity participation and on access to foreign\ngovernment-funded research and development programs, local content requirements, technology\ntransfer requirements and export performance requirements, and restrictions on repatriation of\nearnings, capital, fees and royalties);", "earnings, capital, fees and royalties);\n\u2022 Subsidies, including export subsidies (e.g., export financing on preferential terms and agricultural\nexport subsidies that displace U.S. exports in third country markets) and import substitution\nsubsidies (e.g., subsidies contingent on the purchase or use of domestic rather than imported goods);\n\u2022 Anticompetitive practices (e.g., government-tolerated anticompetitive conduct of state-owned or\nprivate firms that restricts the sale or purchase of U.S. goods or services in the foreign country\u2019s\nmarkets or abuse of competition laws to inhibit trade, and fairness and due process concerns by\ncompanies involved in competition investigatory and enforcement proceedings in the country);\n\u2022 State-owned enterprises (e.g., actions by SOEs and by governments with respect to SOEs involved\nin the manufacture or production of non-agricultural goods or in the supply of services that", "in the manufacture or production of non-agricultural goods or in the supply of services that\nconstitute significant barriers to, or distortions of, U.S. exports of goods and services, U.S.\ninvestments, or U.S. electronic commerce, which may negatively affect U.S. firms and workers.\nThese actions include subsidies and non-commercial advantages provided to and from SOEs and\npractices with respect to SOEs that discriminate against U.S. goods or services, or actions by SOEs\nthat are inconsistent with commercial considerations in the purchase and sale of goods and\nservices);\n2 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\n\u2022 Labor (e.g., concerns with failures by a government to protect internationally recognized worker\nrights1 or to eliminate discrimination in respect of employment or occupation, in cases where these\nfailures influence trade flows or investment decisions in ways that constitute significant barriers to,", "or distortions of, U.S. exports of goods and services, U.S. investment, or U.S. electronic commerce,\nwhich may negatively affect U.S. firms and workers);\n\u2022 Environment (e.g., concerns with a government\u2019s levels of environmental protection, unsustainable\nstewardship of natural resources, and harmful environmental practices that constitute significant\nbarriers to, or distortions of, U.S. exports of goods and services, U.S. investment, or U.S. electronic\ncommerce, which may negatively affect U.S. firms or workers); and\n\u2022 Other barriers (e.g., barriers or distortions that are not covered in any other category above or that\nencompass more than one category, such as bribery and corruption, or that affect a single sector).\nPursuant to Section 1377 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, USTR annually reviews\nthe operation and effectiveness of U.S. telecommunications trade agreements to make a determination on", "whether any foreign government that is a party to one of those agreements is failing to comply with that\ngovernment\u2019s obligations or is otherwise denying, within the context of a relevant agreement, \u201cmutually\nadvantageous market opportunities\u201d to U.S. telecommunication products or services suppliers. The NTE\nReport highlights both ongoing and emerging barriers to U.S. telecommunication services and goods\nexports from the annual review called for in Section 1377.\nThe prevalence of corruption is a consistent complaint from U.S. firms that trade with or invest in other\neconomies. Corruption takes many forms and affects trade and development in different ways. In many\ncountries and economies, it affects customs practices, licensing decisions, and the award of government\nprocurement contracts. If left unchecked, bribery and corruption can negate market access gained through\ntrade negotiations, frustrate broader reforms and economic stabilization programs, and undermine the", "foundations of the international trading system. The United States continues to play a leading role in\naddressing bribery and corruption in international business transactions and has made real progress over\nthe past quarter century building international coalitions to fight bribery and corruption.\nIMPACT OF FOREIGN BARRIERS ON U.S. TRADE\nWherever possible, this report presents estimates of the impact on U.S. exports, U.S. foreign direct\ninvestment, or U.S. electronic commerce of specific foreign trade barriers and other trade distorting\npractices. Where consultations related to specific foreign practices were proceeding at the time of this\nreport\u2019s publication, estimates were excluded in order to avoid prejudice to these consultations.\nThe estimates included in this report constitute an attempt to quantitatively assess the potential effect of\nremoving certain foreign trade barriers to particular U.S. exports. However, the estimates cannot be used", "to determine the total effect on U.S. exports, either to the country in which a barrier has been identified, or\nto the world in general. In other words, the estimates contained in this report cannot be aggregated in order\nto derive a total estimate of gain in U.S. exports to a given country or the world. To provide further\nstatistical context for the reader, Appendix II reports the most recent U.S. Government statistical data on\nU.S. bilateral trade in goods, U.S. bilateral trade in services, and U.S. bilateral foreign direct investment in\nrank order.\n1 Internationally recognized worker rights include the right of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, a\nprohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor, a minimum age for the employment of children, and a prohibition\non the worst forms of child labor, and acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and\noccupational safety and health.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 3", "occupational safety and health.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 3\nTrade barriers or other trade distorting practices affect U.S. exports to foreign markets, as they effectively\nimpose costs on U.S. exports that are not imposed on goods produced in the importing market. These unfair\ntrade practices undermine U.S. exporters\u2019 competitiveness and, in some cases, prevent U.S. goods from\nentering the foreign market entirely. In theory, estimating the impact of a foreign trade measure on U.S.\nexports of goods requires knowledge of the (extra) cost the measure imposes on them, as well as knowledge\nof market conditions in the United States, in the country imposing the measure, and in third countries. In\npractice, such information often is not available.\nWhere sufficient data exist, an approximate impact of tariffs on U.S. exports can be derived by obtaining\nestimates of supply and demand price elasticities in the importing country and in the United States.", "Typically, the U.S. share of imports is assumed constant. When no calculated price elasticities are available,\nreasonable postulated values are used. The resulting estimate of lost U.S. exports is approximate, depends\non the assumed elasticities, and does not necessarily reflect changes in trade patterns with third countries.\nSimilar procedures are followed to estimate the impact of subsidies that displace U.S. exports in third\ncountry markets.\nIn some cases, stakeholder valuations estimating the financial effects of barriers are contained in the report.\nThe methods for computing these valuations are sometimes uncertain. Hence, their inclusion in the NTE\nReport should not be construed as a U.S. Government endorsement of the estimates they reflect.\nMarch 2025\n4 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nALGERIA\nTRADE AGREEMENTS\nThe United States\u2013Algeria Trade and Investment Framework Agreement\nThe United States and Algeria signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement on July 13, 2001.", "The United States and Algeria signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement on July 13, 2001.\nThis Agreement is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the\nUnited States and Algeria.\nIMPORT POLICIES\nTariffs\nAlgeria is not a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) but is a WTO Observer. Goods imported\ninto Algeria face a range of tariffs, from zero percent to 60 percent. Algeria\u2019s average Most-Favored-\nNation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 18.9 percent in 2022 (latest data available). Algeria\u2019s average MFN\napplied tariff rate was 23.7 percent for agricultural products and 18.1 percent for non-agricultural products\nin 2022 (latest data available).\nGoods facing the highest rates are those for which equivalents are manufactured in Algeria. Citing the need\nto encourage local production and ease pressure on the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, Algeria", "to encourage local production and ease pressure on the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, Algeria\nimplemented temporary additional safeguard duties (DAPs) of 30 percent to 200 percent on a list of more\nthan 1,000 manufactured and agricultural goods in April 2019, with the 200 percent rate applied to 10 tariff\nlines covering cement products under the Harmonized System heading 25.23. The items in Algeria\u2019s\ncustoms code that remain duty free are generally European Union-origin goods that are used in\nmanufacturing and are exempt from tariffs under the 2006 European Union\u2013Algeria Association\nAgreement.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nQuantitative Restrictions\nIn November 2022, Algeria released a new Book of Specifications concerning the automotive industry\n(covering automobiles, buses, trucks, construction equipment, and motorcycles) that eliminates previous\nimport quotas but requires import authorization. Due to customs duties, the VAT, and other taxes, vehicles", "cost more than double the market rate when purchased by individuals overseas and imported into Algeria.\nIn November 2023, Algeria authorized 38 domestic automobile companies to import vehicles under the\n2022 regime. A provision in the October 2022 Complementary Finance Law permits those residing in\nAlgeria to import used cars that are three years old or less.\nIn 2020, Algeria established a maximum annual import volume of 4 million metric tons of bread (common)\nwheat. The Algerian president announced in August 2021 that the state grains agency (OAIC) would be\nthe country\u2019s exclusive wheat importer to counteract alleged \u201cillicit practices\u201d by private importers. In\npractice, the OAIC was already the sole buyer of wheat, reselling the commodity on the domestic market\nat subsidized prices. In 2022, the Algerian president announced that the OAIC would have the exclusive\nright to import rice and pulses as well. However, Algeria has not codified the OAIC\u2019s role as the sole buyer", "of wheat, rice, and pulses.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 5\nImport Bans and Import Restrictions\nSince January 2009, Algeria\u2019s Ministry of Health has restricted the importation of a number of generic\npharmaceutical products and medical devices. Since 2007, Algeria has banned the importation of used\nmedical equipment unless the government grants a special exception. Algeria has applied the regulation\nbroadly to block the reimportation of machinery sent abroad for maintenance under warranty, even for\nequipment owned by state-run hospitals.\nAlgeria bans the importation of most types of used machinery, except for refurbished assembly line\nequipment used in domestic industries.\nIn February 2021, the Ministry of Commerce issued a schedule establishing a seasonal ban for individual\nagricultural products. The schedule adjusted a year-round restriction on almond imports to a seasonal ban\ncovering June through August. Since October 2021, Algeria has restricted the importation of additional", "products for which there is minimal demand and for agricultural products not elsewhere specified or\nindicated in Algeria\u2019s tariff schedule. Algeria justified these decisions as necessary to reduce the country\u2019s\nimport bill and to combat fraud.\nIn August 2021, the Ministry of Finance instructed banks to suspend the processing of accounts for\nimporters of products intended for resale starting at the end of October 2021, unless importers complied\nwith a March 2021 decree requiring them to update their import registration to include only one category\nof product per company. The Ministry of Finance subsequently communicated implementation instructions\nto the Ministry of Commerce\u2019s National Center of Commerce Registry (CNRC) but not to importers\nthemselves. Importers must approach the CNRC individually to seek guidance regarding their particular\nsituation rather than rely on publicly available information.\nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation", "Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation\nMany companies continue to face problems clearing goods through Algerian customs. Delays can take\nweeks or months, in many cases without explanation. In addition to a certificate of origin, the Algerian\nGovernment requires all importers to provide certificates of conformity and quality from an independent\nthird party. Algerian customs requires that shipping documents be stamped with a \u201cVisa Fraud\u201d note from\nthe Ministry of Commerce, indicating that the goods have passed a fraud inspection before the goods are\ncleared. Many importations also require authorizations from multiple ministries, which frequently cause\nadditional delays, especially when the regulations do not clearly specify which ministry\u2019s authority is being\nexercised.\nSANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS\nAlgeria bans the production, importation, distribution, or sale of seeds that are the products of\nbiotechnology. Biotechnology seeds imported for research purposes are excepted.", "biotechnology. Biotechnology seeds imported for research purposes are excepted.\nAlgeria maintains animal health certificate requirements for animals and animal products, dairy and dairy\nproducts, and processed products of animal origin. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal\nand Plant Health Inspection Service and the Algerian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development\nServices concluded a certificate for dairy breeding cattle in November 2024 and a certificate for U.S. bovine\nsemen in September 2023. However, challenges with the recognition and approval of other certificates\nremain. In 2021 and again in 2023, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service submitted a letter\nrequesting that Algeria accept the USDA 9060-5 export certificate for U.S. meat and poultry products. As\n6 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nof December 31, 2024, USDA was awaiting a response from the Algerian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural\nDevelopment Services.\nGOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT", "Development Services.\nGOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT\nSince August 2015, all ministries and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are required to purchase domestically\nmanufactured products whenever available. Procurement of foreign goods is permitted only with special\nministerial authorization and if a locally made product cannot be identified. Algeria requires approval from\nthe Council of Ministers for expenditures in foreign currency that exceed DZD 10 billion (approximately\n$74 million).\nAlgeria is not a Member of the WTO and, therefore, is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on\nGovernment Procurement nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\nAlgeria remained on the Watch List in USTR\u2019s 2024 Special 301 Report. Algeria has taken some positive\nsteps to improve intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, including by introducing a draft law", "to amend the IP regulatory framework, creating a new specialized commercial court responsible for\nadjudicating IP\u2013and international trade-related disputes, and engaging in capacity building and training\nefforts for law enforcement, customs officials, judges, and IP protection agencies. However, concerns\nremain, including the lack of an effective mechanism for early resolution of potential pharmaceutical patent\ndisputes, inadequate judicial remedies in cases of patent infringement, the lack of administrative opposition\nin Algeria\u2019s trademark system, and the need to increase enforcement efforts against counterfeiting and\npiracy. In addition, there is a lack of clarity about whether Algeria\u2019s system protects against the unfair\ncommercial use or unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing\napproval for pharmaceutical products.\nELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS", "approval for pharmaceutical products.\nELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS\nAlgeria imposes a maximum value per transaction of DZD 100,000 (approximately $745) on citizens when\nusing international credit cards to purchase goods from outside the country. In addition, Algerian foreign\nexchange regulations prohibit the use of online payment processors to transfer money from one account to\nanother.\nIn May 2018, Algeria enacted a law requiring electronic commerce platforms conducting business in\nAlgeria to register with the government and to host their websites from a data center located in Algeria.\nSuch localization requirements impose unnecessary costs on service suppliers by requiring redundant\nstorage systems. Such requirements are disproportionately burdensome for small firms.\nINVESTMENT BARRIERS\nIn its 2021 Finance Law, Algeria re-imposed the requirement that Algerian individuals or entities own at", "least 51 percent of all projects involving foreign investment (known as the 51/49 rule). The requirement\napplies retroactively to foreign companies already established in Algeria and owning more than 49 percent\nof operations in strategic sectors such as energy, mining, defense, transportation and infrastructure, and\npharmaceuticals, as well as for activities involving raw materials and importers of goods for resale in\nAlgeria. U.S. companies report that the 51/49 rule creates concerns related to their IP rights and financial\ncontrol of the local venture. In July 2022, the Algerian Government enacted an investment law that called\nfor the creation of Invest Algeria, a one-stop shop for prospective investors to register in-country. However,\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 7\nas of 2024, Invest Algeria has not been established, and the Algerian Government has not provided further\ndetails as to when the initiative will be developed.", "details as to when the initiative will be developed.\nThe 2022 Book of Specifications for the automotive industry removed the mandate that automotive\nimporters must be 100 percent Algerian-owned. However, importers of vehicles for resale are required to\npartner with an Algerian company.\nSTATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES\nState Owned Enterprises (SOEs) comprise about two-thirds of the Algerian economy by market value, and\ntheir procurements amount to 20 percent of gross domestic product. The national oil and gas company,\nSonatrach, is the most prominent SOE, but SOEs are present in all sectors of the economy. SOEs leverage\ntheir position in the market to gain advantage over privately owned competitors. For example, state-owned\ntelecommunications provider Alg\u00e9rie T\u00e9l\u00e9com holds a monopoly over all undersea data cable traffic in and\nout of Algeria, offering services at a considerable advantage over private companies operating in the", "telecommunications sector.

Poultry and offal products, the United States\u2019 leading agricultural export to Angola, were assessed\nwith an import duty of 10 percent. The Angolan Government claimed the import duties were meant to\nencourage domestic production and discourage imports of goods produced in sufficient quantities in the\nlocal economy. However, economic analysts in Angola have warned about the risk of product shortages,\nas the country has been only self-sufficient in bananas and salt.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nQuantitative Restrictions\nOn April 12, 2024, Order No. 035/2024 authorized the opening of the Dynamic Electronic Procedure for\nLicensing Rice Imports and launched a public tender for rice imports; nine companies were selected.

The subsidies allow grain to be purchased at a support price, and reduce the price of\nproduction inputs for producers, including for non-product-specific support through subsidized fertilizers,\ndiesel fuel, electricity for irrigation, and agricultural machinery. Support for diesel fuel and agricultural\nmachinery has yet to be notified to the WTO Committee on Agriculture. The subsidized fertilizer is\ndistributed through a controlled channel, which keeps prices reasonably stable. In addition, Bangladesh", "provides export cash incentives for a variety of agricultural products, including vegetables, fruits, and\nprocessed agricultural products. In 2023, Bangladesh notified a backlog of domestic support notifications\nthrough Fiscal Year 2020/2021 to the WTO Committee on Agriculture. The most recent export subsidy\nnotifications cover Fiscal Year 2006/2007.\nBangladesh has never submitted a subsidies notification to the WTO Committee on Subsidies and\nCountervailing Measures. According to publicly available information from the Bangladesh Investment\nand Development Authority, industries exporting more than 80 percent of their goods, regardless of their\nlocations (i.e., within or outside of an export processing zone), can be exempted from income tax for 50\npercent of their export earnings, provided that the industry is not already paying income tax at a reduced\nrate.

The interim government has highlighted fighting corruption as one of its top reform priorities.", "There have been continuous proposals to curb the independence of the Anti-Corruption Commission\n(ACC), the main institutional anticorruption watchdog. The Sarkari Chakori Ain Bill (Government Job\nAct), enacted in October 2018, requires the ACC to seek permission of the authorities concerned before\narresting any government official and limits the ability of the ACC in investigating corruption allegations\nagainst government officials.

Importers have voiced concerns regarding SENASAG\u2019s transparency and\nwith the inconsistent application of agricultural health and food safety standards and regulations.\nSENASAG inspectors routinely use inconsistent and unclear criteria when evaluating food health and safety\nstandards and reviewing supporting importation documents. A lack of transparency in the institution\nincreases the uncertainty about whether products entering Bolivia will be examined using clear and\nconsistent criteria. Bolivia\u2019s facility registration requirements for animal products (beef, pork, poultry,", "dairy, genetic material, and animal by-products) are more onerous than necessary to protect health, and\nSENASAG applies these requirements in an inconsistent manner. These practices have limited the ability\nfor several U.S. agricultural exporters to gain market access to Bolivia, despite the demand for these\nproducts.\nGOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT\nThe Buy Bolivian (Compro Boliviano) program supports domestic production by giving preference margins\nto domestic goods or suppliers in government procurement.\nImporters of foreign products can participate in procurements valued between $142,000 and $5.7 million\nonly in cases where domestically-manufactured products and domestic service providers are unavailable or\nwhen the Bolivian Government does not initially select a domestic supplier. Foreign companies submitting\ntenders for government consultancy contracts are required to do so in association with a Bolivian company,", "although the Bolivian Government occasionally makes exceptions in strategic sectors. For national and\ninternational tenders, preference margins are from 10 percent to 25 percent for Bolivian inputs.\nAs a general matter, the tendering process is nontransparent and acts as a barrier to participation.\nGovernment requirements and the details of the tender are not always defined, and procurement notices are\nnot always made public. For example, many of the state-owned companies, including the state-owned oil\nand gas company, Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales Bolivianos, the state-owned electricity company,\nEmpresa Nacional de Electricidad, and, the state lithium company, Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos, are\nnot required to publish tenders through the official procurement website, Sistema de Contrataciones\nEstatales.

While certain Bolivian laws provide for the protection of copyrights, patents, and trademarks,\nthey do not address trade secret protection. Significant challenges also persist with respect to widespread\npiracy and counterfeiting. The Special 301 Report again encouraged Bolivia to improve its weak protection", "and enforcement of IP.

However, the Bolivian administration that took office at the end of 2020 does\nnot recognize the MOU.\nSTATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES\nIn an effort to control key sectors of the economy, the Bolivian Government has made state-owned\nenterprises (SOEs) a major feature of the Bolivian economy. The government has obtained or maintained\nmajority ownership in a number of companies in a long list of sectors including hydrocarbons, electricity,\nmining, and telecommunications. Bolivia has also created dozens of new public companies in \u201cstrategic\u201d\nsectors such as food production, industrialization of natural resources, air travel, banking, and mining.

In addition, Brazil\u2019s bound rates are often much higher than its applied rates, and\nU.S. exporters face significant uncertainty in the Brazilian market because the government frequently\nmodifies tariff rates within the flexibilities of MERCOSUR.

The beneficiaries of these non-market policies and\npractices, which are constantly evolving, include not only China\u2019s state-owned enterprises but also other\nChinese companies.\nOne of the more far-reaching and harmful industrial plans is Made in China 2025. China\u2019s State Council\nreleased this industrial plan in May 2015.

Under China\u2019s unfair and\nanticompetitive approach to indigenous innovation, the overarching objective is to replace foreign\ntechnologies, products, and services with Chinese technologies, products, and services in the China market\nthrough any means possible so as to enable Chinese companies first to dominate the China market and then\nto use that dominance as a springboard to dominate global markets.\n48 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nMade in China 2025, which covers the first 10 years of a 30-year strategy known as the Strong", "Made in China 2025, which covers the first 10 years of a 30-year strategy known as the Strong\nManufacturing Nation Strategy, seeks to build up Chinese companies in the 10 targeted sectors at the\nexpense of, and to the detriment of, foreign companies and their technologies, products, and services\nthrough a multi-step process from 2015 to 2025. The first objective of Made in China 2025 is to ensure,\nthrough various means, that Chinese companies develop their own \u201cindigenous\u201d technologies, IP, and\nknow-how, either through their own efforts or by extracting or acquiring technologies, IP, and know-how\nfrom foreign enterprises. The next objective of Made in China 2025 is to substitute domestic technologies,\nproducts, and services for foreign technologies, products, and services in the China market. The final\nobjective of Made in China 2025 is to capture much larger worldwide market shares in the 10 targeted\nsectors.", "sectors.\nIn pursuit of these objectives, subsequently released documents set specific targets for capacity and\nproduction levels and market share for the dozens of industries that comprise the 10 broad sectors targeted\nin Made in China 2025. In October 2015, China\u2019s National Manufacturing Strategic Advisory Committee\npublished the Made in China 2025 Key Area Technology Roadmap, and since then it has published three\nupdated editions of this document. The first update, titled the Made in China 2025 Key Area Technology\nand Innovation Greenbook \u2013 Technology Roadmap (2017), was similar to its predecessor in that it set\nexplicit market share and other targets to be attained by Chinese companies in dozens of high-technology\nindustries, often both in the China market and globally.

These tariffs remain in place.\nTariff-Rate Quota Administration for Agricultural Commodities\nMarket access promised through the tariff-rate quota (TRQ) system set up pursuant to China\u2019s WTO\naccession agreement has yet to be fully realized as of December 31, 2024. Due to China\u2019s poorly defined\ncriteria for applicants, unclear procedures for distributing TRQ allocations, and failure to announce quota\nallocation and reallocation results, traders are unsure of available import opportunities and producers\nworldwide face reduced market access opportunities. As a result, for many years, China\u2019s TRQs for wheat,", "corn, and rice would seldom fill even when they were oversubscribed. Since 2020, China\u2019s corn and wheat\nimports have exceeded TRQ levels, but the TRQ issuance, application, and allocation processes still lack\ntransparency, and large state-owned enterprises in China appear to have been the primary beneficiaries of\nthe increased imports.\nIn December 2016, the United States launched a WTO dispute challenging China\u2019s administration of TRQs\nfor wheat, corn, and rice. Consultations took place in February 2017. A WTO panel was established to\nhear the case at the United States\u2019 request in September 2017, and 17 other WTO Members joined as third\nparties. The panel issued its report in April 2019, ruling that China\u2019s administration of tariff-rate quotas\nfor wheat, corn, and rice was WTO-inconsistent. In July 2021, the United States submitted a request for\nauthorization to suspend concessions and other obligations pursuant to Article 22 of the WTO", "authorization to suspend concessions and other obligations pursuant to Article 22 of the WTO\nUnderstanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) on the ground that\nChina had failed to bring its measures into compliance with its WTO obligations. After China objected to\nthis request, the matter was referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 22 of the DSU. The arbitration\nis currently suspended, and the United States continues to closely monitor China\u2019s ongoing administration\nof the tariff-rate quotas for wheat, corn, and rice.\nAs part of the Phase One Agreement, China agreed that, from December 31, 2019, its administration of\nTRQs for wheat, corn, and rice would conform to its WTO obligations. In addition, China agreed to make\nspecific improvements to its administration of the wheat, corn, and rice TRQs, including with regard to the\nallocation methodology, and to the treatment of non-state trading quota applicants. China also committed", "to greater transparency. As of December 31, 2024, however, China had not demonstrated full\nimplementation of these commitments.\nTaxes\nThe Chinese Government has attempted to manage imports of primary agricultural commodities by raising\nor lowering the value-added tax (VAT) rebate to manage domestic supplies. China sometimes reinforces\nits domestic objectives by imposing or retracting VATs. These practices have caused tremendous distortion\nand uncertainty in the global markets for wheat, corn, and soybeans, as well as intermediate processed\nproducts of these commodities.\n52 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nTECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND\nPHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS\nFood Safety\nChina\u2019s ongoing implementation of its 2015 Food Safety Law has led to the introduction of myriad new\nmeasures, including exporter facility and product registration requirements for almost all food and\nagricultural products. Overall, China\u2019s notification of these measures to the WTO Committee on Technical", "Barriers to Trade (TBT Committee) and the WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS\nCommittee) has been uneven.\nIn November 2019, China\u2019s regulatory authorities issued draft measures for public comment that would\nrequire the registration of all foreign food manufacturers. The United States submitted comprehensive\nwritten comments on the draft measures to China\u2019s regulatory authorities. The United States also raised\nconcerns about them before the WTO TBT Committee and the WTO SPS Committee. More than 15 WTO\nMembers supported the concerns raised by the United States.\nIn April 2021, China\u2019s regulatory authorities issued final versions of these measures, now known as Decrees\n248 and 249, with an implementation date of January 1, 2022. In correspondence delivered to foreign\nmissions in Beijing in September 2021, China\u2019s regulatory authorities laid out a non-transparent, multi-tier", "system where producers of certain products are required to be registered by foreign regulatory authorities,\nwhile producers of other products are eligible to self-register. Decrees 248 and 249 also establish new\nlabeling and conformity assessment requirements. In July 2023, China implemented additional registration\nrequirements for certain products under Decree 248, expanding the burden on foreign food safety\nregulators. Moreover, the tasks being required of foreign food safety regulators are fundamentally beyond\nthe traditional roles and authority of food safety regulators. These various additional requirements continue\nto disrupt trade.\nDecree 248 and similar prior measures continue to place excessive strain on food producers, traders, and\nexporting countries\u2019 regulatory authorities, with no apparent added benefit to food safety. They instead\nprovide China with a tool to control food imports in accordance with the dictates of China\u2019s state planners,", "and to retaliate against food producers from countries whose governments challenge Chinese Government\npolicies or practices in non-trade areas.\nIn the Phase One Agreement, China committed that it would not implement food safety regulations that are\nnot science- or risk-based and that it would only apply food safety regulations to the extent necessary to\nprotect human life or health. China also agreed to certain procedures for registering U.S. facilities that\nproduce various food products. Despite repeated U.S. requests for clarification regarding the relationship\nbetween the facility registration procedures set forth in the Phase One Agreement and the requirements of\nDecree 248, China has not provided sufficient information.\nTechnical Barriers to Trade\nStandards\nThe Chinese Government continues to pursue changes to its standards system, including by moving from a\ngovernment-led system to one that incorporates both government guidance and stakeholder input. At times,", "Chinese Government officials have also indicated that they provide equal treatment to foreign companies\nin connection with China\u2019s standardization work. However, in practice, the Chinese Government continues\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 53\nto limit foreign participation in standards setting and, at times, still pursues unique national standards in\norder to protect its domestic industry.\nIn January 2018, China\u2019s revised Standardization Law entered into force. Since then, China has issued\nnumerous implementing measures, some of which contain positive references to the ability of foreign-\ninvested enterprises to participate in China\u2019s standardization activities and purport to recognize the value\nof international standards. Unfortunately, many of these implementing measures cause concern for U.S.\nindustry as they appear to focus on the development of Chinese standards without sufficient consideration", "being given to existing international standards. In addition, they do not explicitly provide that foreign\nstakeholders may participate on equal terms with domestic competitors throughout the standardization\nprocess.\nChina has sought to increase the use of \u201cassociation standards\u201d ostensibly to give industry greater\nparticipation in standards-making. But the development of association standards is opaque and foreign\nparticipation is frequently restricted, depending on the association. In 2023, China issued the Interim\nMeasures on the Adoption of Association Standards as Recommended National Standards to allow for the\nadoption of such standards in China\u2019s national standards system, which further complicates the ability of\nforeign companies to participate in Chinese standards development. In May 2024, China published the\ndraft Administrative Measures for the Adoption of International Standards. Given that this draft measure", "could impact the implementation and administration of China\u2019s obligations under the WTO TBT\nAgreement, the United States has requested that China notify it to the TBT Committee.\nAs these implementing measures have been issued, China\u2019s existing technical committees have continued\nto develop standards. U.S. and other foreign companies have reported that they are often not permitted to\nparticipate in these domestic technical committees, and even in technical committees where participation\nhas been possible for some foreign stakeholders, it has typically been on terms less favorable than those\napplicable to their domestic competitors. For example, the technical committee for cybersecurity standards\n(known as TC-260) allows foreign companies to participate in standards development and setting, with\nseveral U.S. and other foreign companies being allowed to participate in some of the TC-260 working", "several U.S. and other foreign companies being allowed to participate in some of the TC-260 working\ngroups. However, foreign companies report that they are sometimes excluded from serving on technical\ncommittees, and submitting comments on draft standards on the basis that their companies are\nheadquartered outside of China. They also report challenges to participating in key aspects of the\nstandardization process, such as drafting. In addition, they remain prohibited from participating in certain\nTC-260 working groups, such as the working group on encryption standards.\nOver the years, U.S. stakeholders have also reported that, in some cases, Chinese Government officials\nhave pressured foreign companies seeking to participate in China\u2019s domestic standards-setting processes to\nlicense their technology or IP on unfavorable terms. In addition, China has continued to pursue unique\nnational standards in a number of high technology areas. The United States continues to press China to", "address these specific concerns, but this bilateral engagement has yielded minimal progress.\nNotably, U.S. concerns about China\u2019s standards regime are not limited to the implications for U.S.\ncompanies\u2019 access to China\u2019s market. China\u2019s ongoing efforts to develop unique national standards aim\nultimately to serve the interests of Chinese companies seeking to compete globally, as the Chinese\nGovernment\u2019s vision is to use the power of its large domestic market to influence the development of\ninternational standards. This strategy can be seen in reports of China offering incentives to companies and\nindividuals for standards proposals in international standards-setting bodies. While the quality of these\nproposals varies in terms of technical merit, China continues to introduce new standards in the international\nstandards arena, notably in the ICT space, and industry has reported that some of the proposed standards\ndo not have practical need or use.\n54 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS", "do not have practical need or use.\n54 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nIn October 2021, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the State Council\nissued the Outline for the Development of National Standardization, which set targets for China\u2019s\nstandardization system. It reiterates the desire for China\u2019s standardization system to be both guided by the\ngovernment and driven by the market. It also calls for China\u2019s standardization system to refocus from\nquantity to quality and to shift from a domestic focus to an equal domestic and international focus.\nThe October 2021 Outline for the Development of National Standardization is partly based on an initiative\nthat China announced in 2019, known as China Standards 2035. A lack of transparency with regard to the\ninitiative\u2019s objectives is troubling, particularly given longstanding global concerns about discriminatory\nlimitations of foreign participation in China\u2019s standards-setting processes, China\u2019s use of unique national", "standards without basis, and certain licensing practices in China\u2019s standards-setting processes. The United\nStates remains very concerned about China\u2019s policies with regard to standards and has expressed concerns\nto China bilaterally and multilaterally as China continues to develop and issue implementing measures for\nits revised Standardization Law.\nCosmetics\nOver the past several years, the United States and U.S. industry have engaged with China\u2019s Food and Drug\nAdministration (CFDA) and its successor, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), to\nhighlight serious concerns with China\u2019s regulation of cosmetics. Currently, the regulation of cosmetics in\nChina is governed by the Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR), which was issued\nin June 2020 and entered into effect in January 2021. The United States has repeatedly raised serious\nconcerns with the CSAR and its numerous implementing measures, both bilaterally and in meetings of the", "WTO TBT Committee and the WTO Council for Trade in Goods, as have several other WTO Members.\nThe CSAR implementing measures contain provisions that would require companies to disclose full product\nformulations, ingredient suppliers, manufacturing methods, claims, and safety data to both NMPA and local\nagents in China when products are registered or notified. In addition, these measures require companies to\npublish claims abstracts that may contain trade secrets and confidential business information on NMPA\u2019s\nwebsite. The United States has expressed concern to China that its regulators are applying an approach that\ntreats cosmetics as having much higher safety risks than is warranted. China\u2019s filing and registration\nrequirements for cosmetics also significantly diverge from those in other major markets without adequate\njustification, making compliance very burdensome for exporters.\nThe United States is particularly concerned that the CSAR implementing measures do not provide adequate", "assurances as to how undisclosed information, trade secrets and confidential business information will be\nprotected from unauthorized disclosure. China also has not addressed requests from the United States and\ncosmetics right holders that NMPA provide a legally enforceable mechanism to monitor and protect the\ntrade secrets and confidential business information typically identified by companies in their cosmetics\nfilings.\nIn addition, China continues to require duplicative in-country testing to assess many product and ingredient\nsafety and performance claims, without considering the applicability of international data or other means\nof establishing conformity. In response to U.S. concerns, China indicated that it would allow foreign\nlaboratories with facilities in China to conduct its required testing. However, this change does not address\nthe burden of China\u2019s requirement, which does not consider the applicability of testing conducted via", "internationally recognized laboratories outside of China, as well as other means used by foreign regulators\nand industries to assess the conformity of product and ingredient safety and performance claims.\nThe United States also questions China\u2019s assertion that its cosmetics good manufacturing practices (GMP)\nrequirements provide equal treatment for imported and domestic general and special cosmetics. If the\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 55\ngovernment of a cosmetics importer does not issue GMP or manufacturing export certificates, the only\nmeans that China provides to establish conformity with China\u2019s GMP for general cosmetics is animal\ntesting. The United States and other WTO Members have made repeated requests that China consider the\nmany alternative means available to establish GMP conformity, including utilizing second party or third\nparty certificates based upon international GMP standards, such as ISO 22716 guidelines on GMP.", "party certificates based upon international GMP standards, such as ISO 22716 guidelines on GMP.\nAlthough China accepts some GMP certificates issued by U.S. state governments, the process remains\ninconsistent and uncertain for exporters.\nSome foreign companies who manufacture outside of China have been able to access China\u2019s cosmetics\nmarket through cross-border electronic commerce channels without needing to go through some of the\nburdensome regulatory requirements, such as animal testing. However, access to the Chinese market\nthrough these channels is limited and there have been indications that requirements for electronic commerce\ngoods may tighten in the future.\nIn sum, after years of the United States engaging with China bilaterally and via, the WTO and other fora to\npress for clarity, express concerns, and share expertise regarding the regulation of cosmetics, China has not\nyet addressed key U.S. concerns, including the use of good regulatory practices to facilitate cosmetics", "conformity assessment and avoid discriminatory treatment, nor has it provided confidence that U.S. IP will\nbe protected. Until China addresses these concerns, which have not changed over the course of 2024, many\nU.S. companies will be impeded in accessing, or simply unable to access, the China market.\nSanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers\nOverview\nChina remains a difficult and unpredictable market for U.S. agricultural exporters, largely because of\ninconsistent enforcement of regulations and selective intervention in the market by China\u2019s regulatory\nauthorities. China\u2019s unwillingness to routinely base its measures on science-based risk assessment or\ninternational standards and guidelines and to apply regulatory enforcement in a transparent and rules-based\nmanner further complicates and impedes agricultural trade.\nAgricultural Biotechnology Approvals\nThe Chinese regulatory approval process for agricultural biotechnology products creates significant", "The Chinese regulatory approval process for agricultural biotechnology products creates significant\nuncertainty among developers and traders, slowing commercialization of products and creating adverse\ntrade impacts, particularly for U.S. exports of corn, soy, canola, alfalfa, and potatoes. Despite some recent\nproduct approvals, the process remains lengthy and opaque and continues to reflect significant asynchrony\nrelative to approvals issued by regulatory authorities in many other countries.\nFor many years, biotechnology product approvals by China\u2019s regulatory authorities mainly materialized\nonly after high-level political intervention. In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to implement a\ntransparent, predictable, efficient, and science- and risk-based system for the review of products of\nagricultural biotechnology. In the agreement, China also committed to improve its regulatory authorization", "process for agricultural biotechnology products, including by completing reviews of products for use as\nanimal feed or further processing within an average of no more than 24 months and by improving the\ntransparency of its review process. China also agreed to work with importers and the U.S. Government to\naddress situations involving low-level presence of genetically engineered (GE) materials in shipments. In\naddition, China agreed to establish a regulatory approval process for all food ingredients derived from\ngenetically modified microorganisms (GMMs), rather than continue to restrict market access to GMM-\nderived enzymes only.\n56 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nSince 2021, China\u2019s National Biosafety Committee (NBC) has issued biosafety certificates to foreign\ndevelopers for several new GE products for import as feed or for processing, including alfalfa, canola, corn,\ncotton, soybean, and sugarcane products. Some of these approved products had been under review for more", "than 10 years. During the same time period, China has issued biosafety certificates to Chinese developers\nfor dozens of new corn, cotton, and soybean varieties for domestic cultivation, including both transgenic\nand genome-edited products.\nChina\u2019s commitments related to agricultural biotechnology are among the most significant commitments\nunder the Phase One Agreement, but they remain unfulfilled. Despite the commitments that China made,\nthere remains a significant lack of transparency regarding the procedures for convening meetings of the\nNBC, including regarding dates and agenda items for these meetings and the process for notifying\napplicants of outcomes and for soliciting additional information to support product applications. While the\nNBC is required to meet at least two times each year, the meetings are not held pursuant to a regular\nschedule, and information about the meetings is not widely shared with the public in a transparent and", "predictable manner. In addition, in conducting its approval process, China continues to ask for information\nthat is not relevant to a product\u2019s intended use or information that applicants have previously provided. For\nthis and other reasons, China has not reduced the average time for its approval process for agricultural\nbiotechnology products for feed or further processing to no more than 24 months.\nPoultry\nIn the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to maintain measures consistent with the World Organization\nfor Animal Health (WOAH) guidelines for future outbreaks of avian influenza. China also agreed to sign\na regionalization protocol within 30 days of entry into force of the agreement, which it did, to help avoid\nunwarranted nationwide animal disease restrictions in the future. This protocol requires that China resume\nacceptance of poultry imports from states with high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) detections within", "five days of receiving a U.S. report that the states are HPAI-free. Following the implementation of the\nprotocol, China initially complied with its terms.\nStarting in February 2022, the United States notified China of detections of HPAI in multiple U.S. states.\nIn the ensuing months, several states recovered from these detections, and they were deemed HPAI-free by\nthe United States. The United States submitted reports to China for these states and requested approval to\nresume exporting poultry from these states to China. In November 2023, China removed restrictions on\nseven U.S. states, but numerous other HPAI-free U.S. states remain restricted. As of December 31, 2024,\nChina had yet to confirm the restoration of market access for the majority of the impacted U.S. states.\nPork\nChina maintains an approach to U.S. pork that appears to be inconsistent with international standards,\nlimiting the potential of an important export market given China\u2019s growing meat consumption.", "limiting the potential of an important export market given China\u2019s growing meat consumption.\nSpecifically, China bans the use of certain veterinary drugs and growth promotants for which there are\nmaximum residue limits (MRLs) set by Codex Alimentarius (Codex).\nAs part of the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to broaden the list of pork products that are eligible for\nimportation, including processed products such as ham and certain types of offal that are inspected by the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service for both domestic and international\ntrade. China also agreed to conduct a risk assessment for ractopamine in swine and cattle as soon as possible\nand to establish a joint working group with the United States to discuss next steps based on the risk\nassessment.

Certain common testing techniques\nare known to show false positives when the animals being tested have received vaccinations against these\nanimal diseases. In addition, these animal diseases are endemic in China and pose no threat to human\nhealth, and China has not identified any standard or regulation that the shipments in question violated, nor\nhas China identified a pathway for shipments from these facilities to resume normal customs clearance\nprocedures.\nBeef", "procedures.\nBeef\nIn the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to expand the scope of U.S. beef products allowed to be\nimported, to eliminate age restrictions on cattle slaughtered for export to China and to recognize the U.S.\nbeef and beef products\u2019 traceability system.

China subsequently suspended the U.S. facilities that produced these products from exporting\nto China. In several cases, China also suspended the cold storage facilities that had handled the products\nimmediately prior to shipping, despite the fact that these cold storage facilities have no role in raising or\nfeeding cattle or in processing beef products.

The Tendering and Bidding Law falls under the jurisdiction\nof the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and imposes uniform tendering and bidding\nprocedures for certain classes of procurement projects in China, notably construction and works projects,\nwithout regard for the type of entity (e.g., a government agency or a state-owned enterprise) that conducts\nthe procurement. Both laws cover important procurements that GPA Parties would consider to be\ngovernment procurement eligible for coverage under the GPA.", "government procurement eligible for coverage under the GPA.\nChina\u2019s Foreign Investment Law, which entered into force in January 2020, and the related October 2021\nMinistry of Finance Notice 35, state that China will provide equal treatment to foreign companies invested\nin China and to domestic Chinese companies with regard to government procurement opportunities.\nHowever, foreign companies report a marked increase in preference for domestic Chinese companies over\nforeign companies invested in China.\nIn July 2022, the Ministry of Finance issued draft amendments to the Government Procurement Law.\nAmong other changes, these draft amendments would codify the requirement that officials at all levels of\ngovernment refrain from purchasing foreign products whenever domestic products are available.

One of the 24\ntopics addressed in Document 11 is government procurement. Specifically, Article 6 of Document 11 offers\nvarious suggestions for how central level ministries and sub-central government authorities could work to\nensure that foreign-invested enterprises can participate in China\u2019s government procurement market,\nconsistent with existing Chinese law. In Article 6, the State Council recommends clarifying the meaning", "of \u201cproduced in China\u201d as it relates to China\u2019s government procurement laws and regulations and providing\nunspecified support for foreign-invested enterprises to encourage them to develop their cutting-edge\nproducts in China.

Notably, China amended the Patent Law,\nthe Copyright Law and the Criminal Law. At the same time, U.S. right holders have expressed serious", "the Copyright Law and the Criminal Law. At the same time, U.S. right holders have expressed serious\nconcerns about some final measures that lack details and leave too much discretion with the enforcement\nauthorities, which creates uncertainties and can lead to inconsistencies in the scope of coverage and the\navailability and nature of relief. In addition, China has outstanding work to finalize the draft measures that\nit has published and to publish other draft measures in accordance with the Intellectual Property Action\nPlan that it released in April 2020. Outstanding areas to be addressed include areas such as: the protection\nof trade secrets and confidential business information from unauthorized disclosures by government\npersonnel and third-party experts; criminal enforcement of trade secrets theft; enforcement procedures to\ncombat online infringement, including an effective notice and takedown system; the protection and\n60 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS", "60 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nenforcement of trademark rights, particularly against bad faith trademark registrations; increases in the\nminimum and maximum levels of statutory damages and criminal penalties for IP infringement; patent term\nextensions for unreasonable marketing approval delays; and geographical indications.\nMeanwhile, in connection with the Phase One Agreement, China has reported increased enforcement\nactions against counterfeit medicines and increased customs actions against pirated and counterfeit goods.\nHowever, China has yet to demonstrate that it has taken the following actions: (1) published data online\nregarding enforcement actions against counterfeit goods with health and safety risks, enforcement actions\nat physical markets, and enforcement actions at the border; (2) increased enforcement actions against\ncounterfeits with health and safety risks and at physical markets; (3) increased training of customs", "personnel; or (4) ensured the use of only licensed software in government agencies and state-owned\nenterprises.\nGoing forward, the United States will continue to monitor China\u2019s implementation of the IP chapter of the\nPhase One Agreement. The United States will also assess the impact of the final measures that have been\nissued by China and the enforcement actions that China takes.\nTrade Secrets\nSerious inadequacies in the protection and enforcement of trade secrets in China have been the subject of\nhigh-profile engagement between the United States and China in recent years. Several instances of trade\nsecret theft for the benefit of Chinese companies have occurred both within China and outside of China.\nOffenders in many cases continue to operate with impunity. Particularly troubling are reports that actors\naffiliated with the Chinese Government and the Chinese military have infiltrated the computer systems of", "U.S. companies, stealing terabytes of data, including the companies\u2019 proprietary information and IP, for the\npurpose of providing commercial advantages to Chinese enterprises.\nIn high-level bilateral dialogues with the United States over the years, China has committed to issue judicial\nguidance to strengthen its trade secrets regime. China has also committed not to condone state-sponsored\nmisappropriation of trade secrets for commercial use. In addition, the United States has urged China to\nmake certain key amendments to its trade secrets-related laws and regulations, particularly with regard to a\ndraft revision of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law. The United States has also urged China to take actions\nto address inadequacies across the range of state-sponsored actors and to promote public awareness of trade\nsecrets disciplines.\nAt the November 2016 U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) meeting, China", "At the November 2016 U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) meeting, China\nclaimed that it was strengthening its trade secrets regime and bolstering several areas of importance,\nincluding the availability of evidence preservation orders and damages based on market value as well as\nthe issuance of a judicial interpretation on preliminary injunctions and other matters. China amended the\nAnti-Unfair Competition Law, effective January 2018 and April 2019, as well as the Administrative\nLicensing Law, effective April 2019, and the Foreign Investment Law, effective January 2020.\nNevertheless, the amendments still do not fully address critical shortcomings in the scope of protections\nand obstacles to enforcement. In 2022, China published additional draft amendments to the Anti-Unfair\nCompetition Law, but they contain few changes to the law\u2019s trade secrets provisions.\nThe Phase One Agreement significantly strengthens protections for trade secrets and enforcement against", "trade secret theft in China. In particular, the chapter on IP requires China to expand the scope of civil\nliability for misappropriation beyond entities directly involved in the manufacture or sale of goods and\nservices, to cover acts such as electronic intrusions as prohibited acts of trade secret theft and to shift the\nburden of proof in civil cases to the defendants when there is a reasonable indication of trade secret theft.\nIt also requires China to make it easier for right holders to obtain preliminary injunctions to prevent the use\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 61\nof stolen trade secrets, to allow for initiation of criminal investigations without the need to show actual\nlosses, to ensure that criminal enforcement is available for willful trade secret misappropriation, and to\nprohibit government personnel and third party experts and advisors from engaging in the unauthorized\ndisclosure of undisclosed information, trade secrets, and confidential business information submitted to the", "government.\nIn 2020, China published various measures relating to civil, criminal, and administrative enforcement of\ntrade secrets. In September 2020, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued the Provisions on Several Issues\nConcerning the Application of Law in Civil Cases of Trade Secret Infringement and the Interpretation III\non Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Infringement of\nIntellectual Property Rights. In September 2020, the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate and the Ministry of\nPublic Security also issued the Decision on Amendment of Docketing for Prosecution of Criminal Trade\nSecrets Infringement Cases Standards. These measures relate to issues such as the scope of liability for\ntrade secret misappropriation, prohibited acts of trade secret theft, preliminary injunctions, and thresholds\nfor initiations of criminal investigations for trade secret theft. In December 2020, the National People\u2019s", "Congress passed amendments to the Criminal Law that included changes to the thresholds for criminal\ninvestigation and prosecution and the scope of criminal acts of trade secret theft. The Criminal Law\namendments require revisions to certain previously issued judicial interpretations and prosecution\nstandards. However, three years after the passage of the Criminal Law amendments, these other measures\nremain unchanged, and implementation of the Criminal Law amendments therefore remains incomplete.\nIndeed, China has only published a draft judicial interpretation. The United States will continue to monitor\nthe effectiveness of all of these measures.\nBad Faith Trademark Registration\nThe continuing registration of trademarks in bad faith in China remains a significant concern. For example,\n\u201ctrademark squatters\u201d attempt to take advantage when a genuine trademark owner has not yet registered its", "trademark in China by registering that trademark and then trying to sell it to the genuine trademark owner.\nBad faith trademark registration also occurs when trademarks intending to deceive or confuse consumers\nare registered.\nAt the November 2016 JCCT meeting, China publicly noted the harm that can be caused by bad faith\ntrademarks and asserted that it was taking further steps to combat bad faith trademark filings. Amendments\nto the Trademark Law made in 2019 and subsequent implementing measures, including the State\nAdministration for Market Regulation (SAMR) Provisions on Standardizing Applications for Registrations\nof Trademarks issued in 2019 and the Trademark Examination and Review Guidelines updated in 2021 by\nthe China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), require the disallowance of bad faith\ntrademark applications. In January 2023, China proposed further amendments to the Trademark Law\nregarding bad faith trademarks.", "regarding bad faith trademarks.\nHowever, implementation in this area by China suggests that right holders remain insufficiently protected,\nas bad faith trademarks remain widespread and problems persist with the large number of inconsistent\ndecisions, low rate of success for oppositions, lack of transparency in opposition proceedings, and\nunavailability of default judgments against applicants who fail to appear in proceedings. Onerous\ndocumentation requirements are also an ongoing concern for right holders. China acceded to the\nConvention of 5 October 1961 Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents\n(Apostille Convention), effective November 2023. The United States will monitor China\u2019s implementation\nof the obligations under the Apostille Convention and whether it addresses right holders\u2019 concerns\nregarding foreign government document legalization requirements.\n62 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS", "regarding foreign government document legalization requirements.\n62 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nAs a result of these deficiencies, U.S. companies across industry sectors continue to face Chinese applicants\nregistering their marks and \u201cholding them for ransom\u201d or seeking to establish a business building off of\nU.S. companies\u2019 global reputations. The Phase One Agreement requires China to ensure adequate and\neffective protection and enforcement of trademark rights, particularly against bad faith trademark\nregistrations. The United States will continue to closely monitor developments in this area of long-standing\nconcern.\nOnline Infringement\nOnline piracy continues on a large scale in China, affecting a wide range of industries, including those\ninvolved in distributing legitimate music, motion pictures, books and journals, software, and video games.\nWhile increased enforcement activities have helped stem the flow of online sales of some pirated offerings,", "much more sustained action and attention is needed to make a meaningful difference for content creators\nand right holders, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. In response to the COVID-19\npandemic, reports indicate that many infringers have moved online to distribute their pirated and counterfeit\ngoods, which further increases the need for targeted and sustained enforcement measures in the online\nenvironment.\nThe United States has urged China to consider ways to create a broader policy environment to help foster\nthe growth of healthy markets for licensed and legitimate content. The United States has also urged China\nto revise existing rules that have proven to be counterproductive.\nAt the November 2016 JCCT meeting, China agreed to actively promote electronic commerce-related\nlegislation, strengthen supervision over online infringement and counterfeiting, and work with the United", "States to explore the use of new approaches to enhance online enforcement capacity. In December 2016\nand November 2017, China published drafts of a new E-Commerce Law for public comment. In written\ncomments, the United States stressed that the final version of this law should not undermine the existing\nnotice-and-takedown system and should promote effective cooperation in deterring online infringement. In\nAugust 2018, China adopted its new E-Commerce Law, which entered into force in January 2019. This\nlaw was an opportunity for China to institute strong provisions on IP protection and enforcement for its\nelectronic commerce market, which is now the largest in the world. However, as finalized, the law instead\nintroduced provisions that weaken the ability of right holders to protect their rights online and that reduce\nthe liability of China-based electronic commerce platforms for selling counterfeit and other infringing\ngoods.", "goods.\nThe Phase One Agreement requires China to provide enforcement procedures that permit effective and\nexpeditious action against infringement in the online environment, including by requiring expeditious\ntakedowns and by ensuring the validity of takedown notices and counter-notifications. It also requires\nChina to take effective action against electronic commerce platforms that fail to take necessary measures\nagainst infringement.\nIn May 2020, the National People\u2019s Congress issued the Civil Code, which included updated notice-and-\ntakedown provisions. In September 2020, the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued Guiding Opinions on Hearing\nIntellectual Property Disputes Involving E-Commerce Platforms and the Official Reply on the Application\nof Law in Network-Related Intellectual Property Infringement Disputes. These measures relate to issues\nsuch as expeditious takedowns and the validity of notices and counter-notifications, but have only recently", "taken effect. In November 2020, the National People\u2019s Congress adopted long-pending amendments to the\nCopyright Law, including provisions relating to increasing civil remedies for copyright infringement, new\nrights of public performance and broadcasting for producers of sound recordings, and protections against\nthe circumvention of technological protection measures. Right holders have welcomed these developments\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 63\nbut have noted the need for effective implementation as well as new measures to address online piracy.\nThe United States will closely monitor the impact of these measures going forward.\nIn August 2021, SAMR issued draft amendments to the E-Commerce Law for public comment. These draft\namendments further attempt to address concerns that have been raised about procedures and penalties under\nChina\u2019s notice-and-takedown system.\nCounterfeit Goods\nCounterfeiting in China remains widespread and affects a wide range of goods. In April 2019, China", "Counterfeiting in China remains widespread and affects a wide range of goods. In April 2019, China\namended its Trademark Law, effective November 2019, to require civil courts to order the destruction of\ncounterfeit goods, but these amendments still do not provide the full scope of civil remedies for right\nholders. One of many areas of particular U.S. concern involves medications. Despite years of sustained\nengagement by the United States, China has failed to adequately improve its regulation of the manufacture\nof active pharmaceutical ingredients to prevent their use in counterfeit and substandard medications. At\nthe July 2014 meeting of the United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), China\ncommitted to develop and seriously consider amendments to the Drug Administration Law that will require\nregulatory control of the manufacturers of bulk chemicals that can be used as active pharmaceutical", "regulatory control of the manufacturers of bulk chemicals that can be used as active pharmaceutical\ningredients. At the June 2015 S&ED meeting, China further committed to publish revisions to the Drug\nAdministration Law in draft form for public comment and to consider the views of the United States and\nother relevant stakeholders. In October 2017, China published limited draft revisions to the Drug\nAdministration Law and stated that future proposed revisions to the remainder of this law would be\nforthcoming. Although the final Drug Administration Law, issued in August 2019, requires\npharmaceuticals products and active pharmaceutical ingredients to meet manufacturing standards, it\nremains unclear how these requirements will be implemented or enforced.\nThe Phase One Agreement requires China to take effective enforcement action against counterfeit\npharmaceuticals and related products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, and to significantly", "increase actions to stop the manufacture and distribution of counterfeits with significant health or safety\nrisks. The agreement also requires China to provide that its judicial authorities shall order the forfeiture\nand destruction of pirated and counterfeit goods, along with the materials and implements predominantly\nused in their manufacture. In addition, the agreement requires China to significantly increase the number\nof enforcement actions at physical markets in China and against goods that are exported or in transit. It\nfurther requires China to ensure, through third party audits, that government agencies and state-owned\nenterprises only use licensed software.\nIn August 2020, SAMR issued the Opinions on Strengthening the Destruction of Infringing and Counterfeit\nGoods, and the State Council amended the Provisions on the Transfer of Suspected Criminal Cases by\nAdministrative Organs for Law Enforcement, which relate to the transfer of IP cases from administrative", "authorities to criminal authorities. China has reported increased enforcement actions against counterfeit\nmedicines and increased customs actions against pirated and counterfeit goods, but has yet to demonstrate\nthat it has increased enforcement actions against counterfeits with health and safety risks and at physical\nmarkets, increased training of customs personnel, transferred more cases for criminal prosecution, and\nensured the use of only licensed software in government agencies and state-owned enterprises.\nIndigenous Innovation\nPolicies aimed at promoting China\u2019s \u201cindigenous innovation\u201d continue to represent an important\ncomponent of China\u2019s industrialization efforts. Through intensive, high-level bilateral engagement with\nChina since 2009, the United States has attempted to address these policies, which provide various\npreferences when IP is owned or developed in China, both broadly across sectors of China\u2019s economy and\n64 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS", "64 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nspecifically in the government procurement context. For example, at the May 2012 S&ED meeting, China\ncommitted to treat IP owned or developed in other countries the same as IP owned or developed in China.\nThe United States also used the JCCT process in 2012 and subsequent discussions to press China to revise\nor eliminate specific measures that appeared to be inconsistent with this commitment. At the December\n2014 JCCT meeting, China clarified and underscored that it will treat IP owned or developed in other\ncountries in the same manner as domestically owned or developed IP. However, these commitments have\nnot been fulfilled. China continues to pursue myriad policies that require or favor the ownership or\ndevelopment of IP in China.\nThe United States secured a series of similar commitments from China in the government procurement\ncontext, where China agreed to de-link indigenous innovation policies at all levels of the Chinese", "context, where China agreed to de-link indigenous innovation policies at all levels of the Chinese\nGovernment from government procurement preferences, including through the issuance of a State Council\nmeasure mandating that provincial and local governments eliminate any remaining linkages by December\n2011. Many years later, however, this promise had not been fulfilled. At the November 2016 JCCT\nmeeting, in response to U.S. concerns regarding the continued issuance of scores of inconsistent measures,\nChina announced that its State Council had issued a document requiring all agencies and all sub-central\ngovernments to \u201cfurther clean up related measures linking indigenous innovation policy to the provision of\ngovernment procurement preference.\u201d\nOver the years, the underlying thrust of China\u2019s indigenous innovation policies has remained unchanged,\nas China\u2019s leadership has continued to emphasize the necessity of advancing indigenous innovation", "as China\u2019s leadership has continued to emphasize the necessity of advancing indigenous innovation\ncapabilities. Through plans such as the 14th Five-Year Plan for the Protection and Utilization of National\nIntellectual Property Rights, China has continued to implement discriminatory policies encouraging\n\u201cindigenous IP rights\u201d and \u201ccore technologies\u201d that are owned or developed in China. Accordingly, USTR\nhas used mechanisms like a Section 301 investigation to seek to address, among other things, China\u2019s use\nof indigenous innovation policies that effectively force or pressure foreigners to transfer their technologies\nto Chinese companies or develop their IP in China.\nSERVICES BARRIERS\nOverview\nThe prospects for U.S. service suppliers in China should be promising, given the size of China\u2019s market.\nNevertheless, the U.S. share of China\u2019s services market remains well below the U.S. share of the global", "services market, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) continues to\nrate China\u2019s services regime as one of the more restrictive among the world\u2019s major economies.\nIn 2024, numerous challenges persisted in a number of services sectors. As in past years, Chinese regulators\ncontinued to use discriminatory regulatory processes, informal bans on entry and expansion, case-by-case\napprovals in some services sectors, overly burdensome licensing and operating requirements, and other\nmeans to frustrate the efforts of U.S. suppliers of services to achieve their full market potential in China.\nThese policies and practices affect U.S. service suppliers across a wide range of sectors, including cloud\ncomputing, telecommunications, film production and distribution, online video and entertainment services,\nexpress delivery, and legal services. In addition, China\u2019s Cybersecurity Law and related implementing", "measures include mandates to purchase domestic information and communications technology (ICT)\nproducts and services, while China\u2019s Cybersecurity Law, Data Security Law, and Personal Information\nProtection Law, as well as related implementing measures include excessive restrictions on cross-border\ndata flows, and excessive requirements to store and process data locally. These types of data measures\nundermine U.S. services suppliers\u2019 ability to take advantage of market access opportunities in China by\nprohibiting or severely restricting cross-border transfers of information that are routine in the ordinary\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 65\ncourse of business and are fundamental to any business activity. China\u2019s data localization requirements\nalso raise concerns about state surveillance. In addition, China has failed to fully address U.S. concerns in\nareas that have been the subject of WTO dispute settlement, including electronic payment services and", "theatrical film importation and distribution.\nThe Phase One Agreement addresses a number of longstanding trade and investment barriers to U.S.\nproviders of a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, securities, asset management,\ncredit rating and electronic payment services, among others. The barriers addressed in the agreement\ninclude joint venture requirements, foreign equity limitations and various discriminatory regulatory\nrequirements. Removal of these barriers is designed to allow U.S. financial service providers to compete\non a more level playing field and expand their services export offerings in the China market. Nevertheless,\nChina\u2019s excessive restrictions on cross-border data flows and data localization requirements could continue\nto create significant challenges for U.S. financial service providers in China.\nBanking Services\nAlthough China has opened its banking sector to foreign competition in the form of wholly foreign-owned", "banks, China has maintained restrictions on market access in other ways. These restrictions have kept\nforeign banks from establishing, expanding, and obtaining significant market share in China, including\nthrough capital controls and minimum asset thresholds.\nSome years ago, China did take some steps to ease or remove market access restrictions. For example,\nChina removed a number of long-standing barriers for foreign banks, including the $10 billion minimum\nasset requirement for establishing a foreign bank in China and the $20 billion minimum asset requirement\nfor setting up a Chinese branch of a foreign bank. China also removed the cap on the equity interest that a\nsingle foreign investor can hold in a Chinese-owned bank.\nIn the Phase One Agreement, China committed to expand opportunities for U.S. financial institutions,\nincluding bank branches, to supply securities investment fund custody services by considering their global", "assets when they seek licenses. China also agreed to review and approve qualified applications by U.S.\nfinancial institutions for securities investment fund custody licenses on an expeditious basis. In addition,\nChina committed to consider the international qualifications of U.S. financial institutions when evaluating\nlicense applications for Type-A lead underwriting services for all types of non-financial debt instruments\nin China. The United States will continue to monitor these developments.\nSecurities, Asset Management and Futures Services\nIn the Phase One Agreement, China committed to remove the foreign equity caps in the securities, asset\nmanagement and futures sectors by no later than April 1, 2020. It also committed to ensure that U.S.\nsuppliers of securities, asset management and futures services are able to access China\u2019s market on a non-\ndiscriminatory basis, including with regard to the review and approval of license applications.", "discriminatory basis, including with regard to the review and approval of license applications.\nConsistent with its commitments in the Phase One Agreement, China announced that it would allow wholly\nforeign-owned companies for the securities and asset (i.e., fund) management sectors as of April 1, 2020,\nand that it would allow wholly foreign-owned companies for the futures sector as of January 1, 2020. Prior\nto these announcements, China had maintained a foreign equity cap of 51 percent for these sectors. Over\nthe past five years, some U.S. financial institutions have applied for and received licenses to operate as\nwholly foreign-owned enterprises in these sectors. The United States is monitoring these and other\ndevelopments as U.S. companies continue to seek to obtain licenses and undertake operations in these\nsectors.\n66 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nInsurance Services\nIn the Phase One Agreement, China committed to accelerate the removal of the foreign equity caps for life,", "pension, and health insurance so that they are removed no later than April 1, 2020. In addition, it confirmed\nthe removal of the 30-year operating requirement, known as a \u201cseasoning\u201d requirement, which had been\napplied to foreign insurers seeking to establish operations in China in all insurance sectors. China also\ncommitted to remove all other discriminatory regulatory requirements and processes and to expeditiously\nreview and approve license applications.\nConsistent with China\u2019s commitments in the Phase One Agreement, the China Banking and Insurance\nRegulatory Commission (CBIRC) announced that China would allow wholly foreign-owned companies for\nthe life, pension, and health insurance sectors as of January 1, 2020. Prior to this announcement, China had\nmaintained foreign equity caps and only permitted foreign companies to establish as Chinese-foreign joint\nventures in these sectors. In December 2020, CBIRC issued a measure that provided further transparency", "regarding its intention to allow foreign-invested companies to take advantage of this opening.\nIn insurance sectors, the United States continues to encourage China to establish more transparent\nprocedures so as to better enable foreign participation in China\u2019s market, especially in export credit\ninsurance and political risk insurance.\nFinally, some U.S. insurance companies established in China have encountered difficulties in getting\nCBIRC, replaced by the National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR) in March 2023, to issue\ntimely approvals of their requests to open up new internal branches to expand their operations. The United\nStates continues to urge NAFR to issue timely approvals when U.S. insurance companies seek to expand\ntheir branch networks in China.\nElectronic Payment Services\nIn a WTO dispute that it launched in 2010, the United States challenged China\u2019s restrictions on foreign", "companies, including major U.S. credit and debit card processing companies, which had been seeking to\nsupply electronic payment services to banks and other businesses that issue or accept credit and debit cards\nin China. The United States argued that China had committed in its WTO accession agreement to open up\nthis sector in 2006, and a WTO panel agreed with the United States in a decision issued in 2012. China\nsubsequently agreed to comply with the WTO panel\u2019s rulings in 2013, but China did not allow foreign\nsuppliers to apply for licenses until June 2017, when China\u2019s regulator \u2013 PBOC \u2013 finalized the\nestablishment of a two-step licensing process in which a supplier must first complete one year of preparatory\nwork before being able to apply for a license.\nAs of January 2020, when the United States and China entered into the Phase One Agreement, no foreign\nsupplier of electronic payment services had been able to secure the license needed to operate in China\u2019s", "market due largely to delays caused by PBOC. At times, PBOC had refused even to accept applications to\nbegin preparatory work from U.S. suppliers, the first of two required steps in the licensing process.\nMeanwhile, throughout the years that China actively delayed opening up its market to foreign suppliers,\nChina\u2019s national champion, China Union Pay, has used its exclusive access to domestic currency\ntransactions in the China market, and the revenues that come with it, to support its efforts to build out its\nelectronic payment services network abroad, including in the United States. In other words, China\nconsciously decided to maintain market-distorting practices that benefit its own companies, even in the face\nof adverse rulings at the WTO.\nIn the Phase One Agreement, China committed to ensure that PBOC operates an improved and timely\nlicensing process for U.S. suppliers of electronic payment services so as to facilitate their access to China\u2019s\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 67", "FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 67\nmarket. In June 2020, four months after the entry into force of the Phase One Agreement, American Express\nbecame the first foreign supplier of electronic payment services to secure a license from PBOC to operate\nin China\u2019s market. In November 2023, after years of delays, Mastercard was finally able to secure a license\nto operate in the China market. Meanwhile, PBOC has been delaying action for even longer periods of\ntime on the licensing application submitted by another U.S. supplier, Visa. The United States continues to\nclosely monitor this situation with concern.\nInternet-Enabled Payment Services\nPBOC first issued regulations for non-bank suppliers of online payment services in 2010, and it\nsubsequently began processing applications for licensees. Regulations were further strengthened in 2015,\nwith additional provisions aimed at increasing security and traceability of transactions. According to a U.S.", "industry report, of more than 200 licenses issued as of June 2014, only two had been issued to foreign-\ninvested suppliers, and those two were for very limited services. This report provided clear evidence\nsupporting stakeholder concerns about the difficulties they faced entering China\u2019s market and the slow\nprocess foreign firms face in getting licensed. In 2018, PBOC announced that it would allow foreign\nsuppliers, on a nondiscriminatory basis, to supply Internet-enabled payment services. At the same time, as\nin many other sectors, PBOC requires suppliers to localize their data and facilities in China. In January\n2021, PayPal became the first foreign company to obtain full ownership of a payment platform in China,\nalong with a license to supply payment services. The United States will continue to closely monitor\ndevelopments in this area.\nTelecommunications Services\nChina\u2019s restrictions on basic telecommunications services, such as an informal ban on new entry, a 49-", "percent foreign equity cap, a requirement that foreign suppliers can only enter into joint ventures with state-\nowned enterprises, and exceedingly high capital requirements, have blocked foreign suppliers from\naccessing China\u2019s basic telecommunications services market. Since China acceded to the WTO more than\ntwo decades ago, not a single foreign firm has succeeded in establishing a new joint venture to enter this\nsector.\nRestrictions maintained by China on less highly regulated value-added telecommunications services also\nhave created serious barriers to market entry for foreign suppliers seeking to enter this sector. These\nrestrictions include opaque and arbitrary licensing procedures, foreign equity caps, and periodic, unjustified\nmoratoria on the issuance of new licenses. As a result, only a few dozen foreign-invested suppliers have\nsecured licenses to provide value-added telecommunications services, while there are thousands of licensed\ndomestic suppliers.", "domestic suppliers.\nInternet Regulatory Regime\nChina\u2019s Internet regulatory regime is restrictive and non-transparent, affecting a broad range of commercial\nservices activities conducted via the Internet, and is overseen by multiple agencies without clear lines of\njurisdiction. China\u2019s Internet economy has boomed over the past decade and is second in size only to that\nof the United States. Growth in China has been marked in service sectors similar to those found in the\nUnited States, including retail websites, search engines, vocational and adult online education, travel,\nadvertising, audio-visual and computer gaming services, electronic mail and text, online job searches,\nInternet consulting, mapping services, applications, web domain registration, and electronic trading.\nHowever, in the China market, Chinese companies dominate due in large part to restrictions imposed on\nforeign companies by the Chinese Government. At the same time, foreign companies continue to encounter", "major difficulties in attempting to offer these and other Internet-based services on a cross-border basis.\n68 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nChina continues to engage in extensive blocking of legitimate websites, imposing significant costs on both\nsuppliers and users of web-based services and products. China currently blocks most of the largest global\nsites, and U.S. industry research has calculated that more than 10,000 sites are blocked, affecting billions\nof dollars in business, including communications, networking, application stores, news, and other sites.\nEven when sites are not permanently blocked, the often arbitrary implementation of blocking, and the\nperformance-degrading effect of filtering all traffic into and outside of China, significantly impair the\nsupply of many cross-border services, often to the point of making them unviable.\nVoice over Internet Protocol Services\nWhile computer-to-computer Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) services are permitted in China, China\u2019s", "regulatory authorities have restricted the ability to offer VOIP services interconnected to the public\nswitched telecommunications network (i.e., to call a traditional phone number) to basic telecommunications\nservice licensees. There is no obvious rationale for such a restriction, which deprives consumers of a useful\ncommunication option, and the United States continues to advocate for eliminating it.\nCloud Computing Services\nEspecially troubling is China\u2019s treatment of foreign companies seeking to participate in the development\nof cloud computing services, including computer data processing and storage services and software\napplication services provided over the Internet. China prohibits foreign companies established in China\nfrom directly providing any of these services. Given the difficulty in providing these services on a cross-\nborder basis (largely due to restrictive Chinese policies), the only option that a foreign company has to", "access the China market is to establish a contractual partnership with a Chinese company, which is the\nholder of the necessary Internet data center license, and turn over its valuable technology, IP, know-how,\nand branding as part of this arrangement. While the foreign service supplier earns a licensing fee from the\narrangement, it has no direct relationship with customers in China and no ability to independently develop\nits business. It has essentially handed over its business to a Chinese company that may well become a\nglobal competitor. This treatment has generated serious concerns in the United States and among other\nWTO Members as well as U.S. and other foreign companies.\nIn major markets, including China, cloud computing services are typically offered through commercial\npresence in one of two ways. They are offered as an integrated service in which the owner and operator of\na telecommunication network also offers computing services, including data storage and processing", "a telecommunication network also offers computing services, including data storage and processing\nfunction, over that network, or they are offered as a stand-alone computer service, with connectivity to the\ncomputing service site provided separately by a telecommunications service supplier. Although China\u2019s\ncommitments under the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) include services relevant\nto both of these approaches, neither one is currently open to foreign-invested companies in China.\nIn October 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) launched a pilot program in\nfour free trade zones, including in Beijing and Shanghai, that is to allow foreign companies to wholly own\nand operate Internet data centers and content delivery networks. It is not clear whether or even how this\nprogram could result in any commercially meaningful market access openings.

For example, China prohibits retransmission of foreign TV channels, foreign\ninvestment in TV production, and foreign investment in TV stations and channels. China also imposes\nquotas on the amount of foreign programming that can be shown on a Chinese TV channel each day. In\naddition, in September 2018, the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) issued a\nproblematic draft measure that would impose new restrictions in China\u2019s already highly restricted market", "for foreign creative content. It would require that spending on foreign content account for no more than 30\npercent of available total programs in each of several categories, including foreign movies, TV shows,\ncartoons, documentaries, and other foreign TV programs, made available for display via broadcasting\ninstitutions and online audio-visual content platforms. It also would prohibit foreign TV shows in prime\ntime. Although this measure has not yet been issued in final form, it continues to raise serious concerns, as\nit appears that, as a matter of practice, it has been implemented in China since 2021, including by online\naudio-visual content platforms.\nTheatrical Films\nIn February 2012, the United States and China reached an alternative resolution with regard to certain\nrulings relating to the importation and distribution of theatrical films in a WTO dispute that the United\nStates had won.

However, China has not yet fully implemented its MOU\ncommitments, including with regard to critical commitments to open up film distribution opportunities for\nimported films. As a result, the United States has been pressing China for full implementation of the MOU.\nIn 2017, in accordance with the terms of the MOU, the two sides began discussions regarding the provision\nof further meaningful compensation to the United States in an updated MOU. These discussions continued\nuntil March 2018, before stalling when China embarked on a major government reorganization that\ninvolved significant changes for China\u2019s Film Bureau.

The United States will continue pressing China to fulfill its obligations.\nOnline Video and Entertainment Services\nChina restricts the online supply of foreign video and entertainment services through measures affecting\nboth content and distribution platforms, as part of its authoritarian governance structure. China requires\nforeign companies to license their content to Chinese companies and also imposes burdensome restrictions\non content, which are implemented through exhaustive content review requirements that are based on vague\nand otherwise non-transparent criteria. With respect to distribution platforms, NRTA has required Chinese", "online platform suppliers to spend no more than 30 percent of their acquisition budget on foreign content.\nNRTA has also instituted numerous measures that prevent foreign suppliers from qualifying for a license,\nsuch as requirements that video platforms all be Chinese-owned. NRTA and other Chinese regulatory\nauthorities have also taken actions to prevent the cross-border supply of online video services, which may\nimplicate China\u2019s GATS commitments relating to video distribution.\nLegal Services\nChina restricts the types of legal services that can be provided by foreign law firms, including through a\nprohibition on foreign law firms hiring lawyers qualified to practice Chinese law. It also restricts the ability\nof foreign law firms to represent their clients before Chinese Government agencies and imposes lengthy\n70 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\ndelays on foreign law firms seeking to establish new offices. In addition, beginning with the version of", "China\u2019s Foreign Investment Negative List that entered into force in July 2020, China has added an explicit\nprohibition on the ability of a foreign lawyer to become a partner in a domestic law firm. Reportedly, China\nis also considering draft regulatory measures that would even further restrict the ability of foreign law firms\nto operate in China.\nExpress Delivery Services\nThe United States continues to have concerns regarding China\u2019s implementation of the 2009 Postal Law\nand related regulations through which China prevents foreign suppliers of express delivery services from\nparticipating fully in the document delivery market. Meanwhile, in the package market, China applies\noverly burdensome and inconsistent regulatory approaches and reportedly has provided more favorable\ntreatment to Chinese service suppliers when awarding business permits.

China\u2019s data regime is governed by a series of overarching laws such\nas China\u2019s Data Security Law, which entered into force in September 2021, and China\u2019s Personal\nInformation Protection Law, which entered into force in November 2021. These laws operate together with\nthe 2017 Cybersecurity Law, the 2015 National Security Law, and various implementing measures,\nincluding the 2022 Security Assessment Measures for Outbound Transfers of Data, to prohibit or severely", "restrict cross-border transfers of \u201cimportant data.\u201d China has yet to provide a consistent and widely\napplicable definition of key terms like \u201cimportant data\u201d across industry sectors and Free Trade Zones\n(FTZs). The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has deferred instead to sub-central and sectoral\nregulators to develop their own definitions. The CAC has also enabled FTZs to develop their own lists of\n\u201cimportant data.\u201d This approach has led to conflicting definitions of the term \u201cimportant data\u201d throughout\nChina, creating confusion for foreign companies. These laws and implementing measures also impose local\ndata storage and processing requirements on companies operating in China that collect \u201cimportant data\u201d\nand, in certain cases, personal information.

These measures are overly broad and serve to promote China\u2019s domestic\nindustry at the expense of the industries of China\u2019s trading partners. Of particular concern are the Measures\nfor Cybersecurity Review, first issued in 2016 and later updated in 2020 and again in 2021. This measure\nputs in place a review process to regulate the purchase of information and communications technology\n(ICT) products and services by critical information infrastructure operators and online platform operators\nin China. In addition, in September 2022, China published a draft revision of the Cybersecurity Law with\na 15-day public comment period. The draft revision would introduce penalties on operators of critical", "information infrastructure who use products or services that have not undergone the required security\nreview, and it would also raise fines for certain violations of the Cybersecurity Law.\nAs demonstrated in implementing measures for the Cybersecurity Law, China\u2019s approach is to impose\nsevere restrictions on a wide range of U.S. and other foreign ICT products and services with an apparent\ngoal of supporting China\u2019s technology localization policies by encouraging the replacement of foreign ICT\nproducts and services with domestic ones. U.S. and other foreign stakeholders and governments around\nthe world have expressed serious concerns about requirements that ICT equipment and other ICT products\nand services in critical sectors be \u201csecure and controllable,\u201d as these requirements are used by the Chinese\nGovernment to disadvantage foreign companies.\nIn addition to the Cybersecurity Law, China has referenced its \u201csecure and controllable\u201d requirements in a", "variety of measures dating back to 2013. Through these measures, China has mandated that Chinese\ninformation technology users purchase Chinese products and favor Chinese service suppliers, imposed\ndomestic research and development (R&D) requirements, considered the location of R&D as a\ncybersecurity risk factor, and required the transfer or disclosure of source code or other IP. In the 2019\nupdate of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review, China added political, diplomatic, and other \u201cnon-\nmarket\u201d developments as potential risk factors to be considered.\nIn 2015, China enacted a National Security Law and a Counterterrorism Law, which include provisions\nciting not only national security and counterterrorism objectives but also economic and industrial policies.\nThe State Council also published a plan in 2015 that sets a timetable for adopting \u201csecure and controllable\u201d\nproducts and services in critical government ministries by 2020.", "products and services in critical government ministries by 2020.\nMeanwhile, sector-specific policies under this broad framework continue to be proposed and deployed\nacross China\u2019s economy. A high-profile example from December 2014 was a proposed measure drafted\nby the China Banking Regulatory Commission that called for 75 percent of ICT products used in the\nbanking system to be \u201csecure and controllable\u201d by 2019 and that would have imposed a series of criteria\nthat would shut out foreign ICT providers from China\u2019s banking sector. Not long afterwards, a similar\nmeasure was proposed for the insurance sector.\nIn 2015, the United States, in concert with other governments and stakeholders around the world, raised\nserious concerns about China\u2019s \u201csecure and controllable\u201d regime at the highest levels of government within\nChina. During a state visit in September 2015 in Washington, D.C., the U.S. and Chinese Presidents", "China. During a state visit in September 2015 in Washington, D.C., the U.S. and Chinese Presidents\ncommitted to a set of principles for trade in information technologies. The issue also was raised in\nconnection with the June 2015 S&ED meeting and the November 2015 JCCT meeting, with China making\na series of additional important commitments with regard to technology policy. China reiterated many of\nthese commitments at the November 2016 JCCT meeting, where it affirmed that its \u201csecure and\ncontrollable\u201d policies are not to unnecessarily limit or prevent commercial sales opportunities for foreign\nICT suppliers or unnecessarily impose nationality-based conditions and restrictions on commercial ICT\n72 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\npurchases, sales or uses. China also agreed that it would notify relevant technical regulations to the WTO\nTBT Committee.\nAgain, however, China has not honored its promises. The numerous draft and final implementation", "Again, however, China has not honored its promises. The numerous draft and final implementation\nmeasures issued by China since 2017 in the area of cybersecurity raise serious questions about China\u2019s\napproach to cybersecurity regulation. China\u2019s measures do not appear to be in line with China\u2019s prior\ncommitments, and global stakeholders have grown even more concerned about the implications of China\u2019s\nICT security measures across the many economic sectors that employ digital technologies.\nFinally, the United States and U.S. stakeholders remain concerned about a nonpublic document authored\nby the State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) in 2022. Known as\nDocument 79, this document reportedly sets out timelines for using only secure and controllable ICT\nproducts in the ICT systems of the Chinese Government, the CCP, and state-owned enterprises. The\nnonpublic nature of Document 79 and China\u2019s lack of transparency with regard to a policy that affects a", "broad range of industries signal that China may be seeking to evade past commitments to the maintenance\nof a non-discriminatory, non-trade restrictive approach to cybersecurity regulation.\nEncryption\nUse of ICT products and services is increasingly dependent on robust encryption, an essential functionality\nfor protecting privacy and safeguarding sensitive commercial information. Onerous requirements on the\nuse of encryption, including intrusive approval processes and, in many cases, mandatory use of indigenous\nencryption algorithms (e.g., for Wi-Fi and 4G cellular products), continue to be cited by stakeholders as a\nsignificant trade barrier in China.\nIn October 2019, China adopted a Cryptography Law that includes restrictive requirements for commercial\nencryption products that \u201cinvolve national security, the national economy and people\u2019s lives, and public\ninterest,\u201d which must undergo a security assessment. This broad definition of commercial encryption", "interest,\u201d which must undergo a security assessment. This broad definition of commercial encryption\nproducts that must undergo a security assessment raises concerns that the new Cryptography Law will lead\nto unnecessary restrictions on foreign ICT products and services. In August 2020, the State Cryptography\nAdministration issued the draft Commercial Cryptography Administrative Regulations to implement the\nCryptography Law. This draft measure did not address the concerns that the United States and numerous\nother stakeholders had raised regarding the Cryptography Law.\nGoing forward, the United States will continue to monitor implementation of the Cryptography Law and\nrelated measures. The United States will remain vigilant toward the introduction of any new requirements\nhindering technologically neutral use of robust, standardized encryption.\nINVESTMENT BARRIERS\nChina seeks to protect many domestic industries through a restrictive investment regime. Many aspects of", "China\u2019s current investment regime continue to cause serious concerns for foreign investors. For example,\nChina\u2019s Foreign Investment Law and implementing regulations, both of which entered into force in January\n2020, perpetuate separate regimes for domestic investors and investments and foreign investors and\ninvestments.\nThere has also been a lack of substantial liberalization of China\u2019s investment regime, evidenced by the\ncontinued application of prohibitions, foreign equity caps and joint venture requirements, and other\nrestrictions in certain sectors. China\u2019s most recent version of its Foreign Investment Negative List, which\nreplaces the 2022 version and entered into force in November 2024, provides no meaningful reductions in\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 73\nthe significant investment restrictions that continue to apply in a number of areas important to foreign\ninvestors, such as key services sectors, certain types of agriculture and several extractive industries. With", "regard to services sectors, China maintains prohibitions or restrictions in key sectors such as cloud\ncomputing services and other Internet-related services, telecommunications services, film production and\nfilm distribution services, and video and entertainment software services. With regard to agriculture, China\nmaintains prohibitions on the development of agricultural biotechnologies and restrictions on the\ndevelopment of new varieties of corn and wheat. Similarly, China maintains prohibitions on the\nexploration, mining, and processing of all of the 17 types of rare earths as well as tungsten.\nChina\u2019s Foreign Investment Law, implementing regulations, and other related measures suggest that China\nis pursuing the objective of replacing its case-by-case administrative approval system for a broad range of\ninvestments with a system that would only be applied to \u201crestricted\u201d sectors. However, it currently remains", "unclear whether China is fully achieving that objective in practice. Moreover, even for sectors that have\nbeen liberalized, the potential for heightened licensing requirements for foreign companies or the\napplication of licensing processes that disadvantage foreign companies could make it difficult to achieve\nmeaningful market access. In addition, the potential for a new and overly broad national security review\nmechanism, and the increasingly adverse impact of China\u2019s Cybersecurity Law, Data Security Law and\nPersonal Information Protection Law and related implementing measures, have serious negative\nimplications for foreign investors and investments. Foreign companies also continue to report that Chinese\nGovernment officials may condition investment approval on a requirement that a foreign company transfer\ntechnology, conduct R&D in China, satisfy performance requirements relating to exportation or the use of\nlocal content or make valuable, deal-specific commercial concessions.", "local content or make valuable, deal-specific commercial concessions.\nOver the years, the United States has repeatedly raised concerns with China about its restrictive investment\nregime. Given that China\u2019s investment restrictions place pressure on U.S. companies to transfer technology\nto Chinese companies, they were a focus of USTR\u2019s Section 301 investigation. The responsive actions\ntaken by the United States in that investigation are intended in part to address this concern.\nIn the past several years, the investment climate has turned unusually challenging, in large part because of\nactions taken by the Chinese Government. For example, purportedly in implementing amendments to\nChina\u2019s Counterespionage Law that broaden the definition of espionage, Chinese security officials recently\nraided and detained staff at several multinational companies operating in China that help investors perform", "due diligence regarding existing or potential new investments in China. With no effective judicial recourse\nor other means for challenging these actions, investors have reported that their confidence in China has\nbeen severely damaged.\nIn August 2023, China\u2019s State Council released a new measure, titled Further Optimizing the Foreign\nInvestment Environment and Enhancing the Attraction of Foreign Investment, in the apparent hope of\nattracting increased levels of foreign investment. Known as Document No. 11, this measure sets forth\ngeneral guidance to central level ministries and sub-central government authorities on 24 topics related to\nforeign investment. China has issued similar guidance in the past without meaningfully following through.\nSUBSIDIES\nIndustrial Subsidies\nChina continues to provide massive subsidies to its domestic industries, which have caused injury to U.S.\nindustries and the industries of other WTO Members. Some of these subsidies also appear to be prohibited", "under WTO rules. Over the years, to the extent possible, the United States has sought to address these\n74 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nsubsidies through countervailing duty proceedings conducted by the U.S. Department of Commerce and\ndispute settlement cases at the WTO.\nThe United States and other WTO Members also have continued to press China to notify all of its subsidies\nto the WTO in accordance with its WTO obligations, while also submitting counter notifications listing\nhundreds of subsidy programs that China has failed to notify. Over the years, China\u2019s required WTO\nsubsidy notifications have marginally improved at times in terms of timeliness and completeness but not\nconsistently. Nevertheless, since joining the WTO more than 20 years ago, China has not yet submitted to\nthe WTO a complete notification of subsidies maintained by the central government, and it did not notify a\nsingle sub-central government subsidy until July 2016, when it provided information largely only on sub-", "central government subsidies that the United States had challenged as prohibited subsidies in a WTO\ndispute. While China has notified a small number of sub-central government subsidies in its more recent\nsubsidy notifications, these notifications are woefully inadequate and do not address the most distortionary\nsub-central government subsidies, such as the increasingly prolific, and very large, \u201cgovernment guidance\nfunds\u201d that can be found at all levels of government in China.\nSeparately, the United States has continued to pursue a series of proposals to reform the functioning of the\nWTO Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. These proposals have focused on ensuring\nthat Members timely provide written responses to written questions regarding their subsidy programs.\nAgricultural Domestic Support\nFor several years, China has been significantly increasing the value of domestic subsidies and other support", "measures for its agricultural sector. China maintains direct payment programs, minimum support prices\nfor basic commodities, and input subsidies. China has implemented a cotton reserve system, based on\nminimum purchase prices, and cotton target price programs. In 2016, China established subsidies for starch\nand ethanol producers to incentivize the purchase of domestic corn, resulting in higher volumes of exports\nof processed corn products from China in 2017 and 2018. In addition, in 2022, China began encouraging\nsoybean production through various support programs, such as through increased subsidies for crop\nrotations, awards to counties with high oilseed production, incentives to promote the intercropping of corn\nand soybeans, and subsidies for \u201cdemonstration farming\u201d of soybeans on alkali and salty land.\nThere is also evidence that China subsidizes its livestock industry, including at the provincial and local", "government levels. For example, in the swine industry, state-owned banks offer large-scale swine\noperations discounted loans, while provincial and local governments offer preferential land deals and rail\nand utility consolidation. Meanwhile, in the dairy industry, provincial and local governments offer\nsubsidies for milk and whole milk powder production.\nChina submitted a notification concerning domestic support measures to the WTO in May 2015, but it only\nprovided information up to 2010. In December 2018, China notified domestic support measures for the\nperiod 2011-2016. This notification showed that China had exceeded its de minimis level of domestic\nsupport for soybeans (in 2012, 2014 and 2015), cotton (from 2011 to 2016), corn (from 2013 to 2016),\nrapeseed (from 2011 to 2013), and sugar (2012). The situation was likely even worse, as the methodologies\nused by China to calculate domestic support levels result in underestimates. Moreover, the support", "used by China to calculate domestic support levels result in underestimates. Moreover, the support\nprograms notified by China seemingly failed to account for support given at the sub-national level by\nprovincial and local governments and, possibly, support administered through state-owned enterprises. In\nDecember 2022 and September 2024, China submitted additional notifications concerning domestic support\nmeasures for the years 2017 through 2022. These notifications show that China exceeded de minimis\nsupport for wheat, rice, and soybeans in 2017, 2018, and 2019. These notifications also show new payments\nunder programs notified as production-limiting for soybeans and rice, which is in addition to previously\nnotified production-limiting support for cotton and corn. China\u2019s most recent notifications seemingly not\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 75\nonly fail to address concerns raised with regard to notifications made in previous years, but also give rise", "to additional concerns with regard to how new support measures are classified.\nIn September 2016, the United States launched a WTO dispute challenging China\u2019s government support\nfor the production of wheat, corn, and rice as being in excess of China\u2019s commitments. Like other WTO\nMembers, China committed to limit its support for producers of agricultural commodities. China\u2019s market\nprice support programs for wheat, corn, and rice appear to provide support far exceeding the agreed levels.\nThis excessive support creates price distortions and skews the playing field against U.S. farmers. The WTO\npanel hearing the case issued its decision in February 2019, ruling that China\u2019s domestic support for wheat\nand rice was WTO-inconsistent. In July 2020, the United States submitted a request for authorization to\nsuspend concessions and other obligations pursuant to Article 22 of the DSU on the ground that China had", "failed to bring its measures into compliance with its WTO obligations. After China objected to this request,\nthe matter was referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 22 of the DSU. The arbitration is currently\nsuspended, and the United States continues to closely monitor the operation of China\u2019s market price support\nprograms for wheat and rice.\nFisheries Subsidies\nIt is estimated that China is the world\u2019s largest provider of harmful fisheries subsidies, with support\nexceeding $4.2 billion annually. These subsidies contribute to overfishing and overcapacity that threatens\nglobal fish stocks. Indeed, China is the world\u2019s largest producer of marine capture fisheries and, in the\nyears since its WTO accession, has continued to support its fishing fleet through subsidies and other market-\ndistorting means. China\u2019s annual fisheries harvest is nearly double that of the next largest producer in the", "world in terms of marine capture and triple that of other top producers, like the United States, India, and\nIndonesia. At the same time, reports continue to emerge about Chinese-flagged fishing vessels engaging\nin illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in distant waters, including in areas under the\njurisdiction of other WTO Members. While China has made some progress in reducing subsidies to\ndomestic fisheries, it continues to shift its overcapacity to international fisheries by providing a much higher\nrate of subsidy support to Chinese distant water fishery enterprises.\nFor several years, the United States has been raising its long-standing concerns over China\u2019s fisheries\nsubsidies programs. In 2015, the United States submitted a written request for information pursuant to\nArticle 25.8 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies Agreement).\nThis submission addressed fisheries subsidies provided by China at central and sub-central levels of", "government. The subsidies at issue were set forth in nearly 40 measures and included a wide range of\nsubsidies, including fishing vessel acquisition and renovation grants, grants for new fishing equipment,\nsubsidies for insurance, subsidized loans for processing facilities, fuel subsidies, and the preferential\nprovision of water, electricity, and land. When China did not respond to this request, the United States\nsubmitted an Article 25.10 counter notification covering these same measures. More recent subsidy\nnotifications by China have been more fulsome, but still incomplete.\nGoing forward, the United States will continue to investigate the full extent of China\u2019s fisheries subsidies\nand will continue to press China to fully comply with its relevant WTO subsidy obligations. The United\nStates also will urge WTO Members to support additional, ambitious disciplines on harmful fisheries\nsubsidies as part of the further WTO negotiations on fisheries subsidies.\nExcess Capacity", "subsidies as part of the further WTO negotiations on fisheries subsidies.\nExcess Capacity\nBecause China employs a state-led approach to the economy and its economy is the second largest in the\nworld, China is the world\u2019s leading offender in creating non-market excess capacity. For years, China has\nbeen responsible for maintaining severe and persistent excess capacity in several industries, including steel,\n76 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\naluminum, solar, and shipbuilding. China is also creating severe excess capacity in other industries, such\nas electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries, among others, through its pursuit of industrial plans such as\nMade in China 2025, pursuant to which the Chinese Government is providing hundreds of billions of dollars\nto support Chinese companies and requiring them to achieve preset targets for domestic market share \u2013 at\nthe expense of imports \u2013 and global market share in each of 10 advanced manufacturing industries.", "the expense of imports \u2013 and global market share in each of 10 advanced manufacturing industries.\nIn manufacturing industries such as steel, aluminum, and shipbuilding, China\u2019s economic planners have\ncontributed to massive excess capacity in China through various government support measures, often in\nfurtherance of China\u2019s industrial targeting. For steel, the resulting over-production has distorted global\nmarkets, harming U.S. workers and manufacturers in both the U.S. market and third country markets, where\nU.S. exports of steel and steel-intensive products compete with exports from China. This over-production\nhas similarly harmed the workers and manufacturers of many of the United States\u2019 allies and partners.\nWhile China has publicly acknowledged excess capacity in its steel and aluminum industries, it has yet to\ntake meaningful steps to address the root causes of this problem in a sustainable way. Indeed, China\ncontinues to replicate these results in other industries.", "continues to replicate these results in other industries.\nFrom 2000 to 2023, China accounted for 73 percent of global steelmaking capacity growth, an increase\nwell in excess of the increase in global and Chinese demand over the same period. Currently, China\u2019s\ncapacity represents about one-half of global capacity and more than twice the combined steelmaking\ncapacity of the EU, Japan, the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil.\nAt the same time, China\u2019s steel production is continually reaching new highs, eclipsing demand. In 2020,\nChina\u2019s steel production climbed above one billion metric tons for the first time, reaching 1,065 million\nmetric tons, a seven percent increase from 2019, and remained high at 1,019 million metric tons in 2023,\ndespite a significant contraction in domestic steel demand. This sustained ballooning of steel production,\ncombined with weakening economic growth and a slowdown in the Chinese construction sector, has", "combined with weakening economic growth and a slowdown in the Chinese construction sector, has\nflooded the global market with excess steel and steel-intensive products at a time when steel and other\nmanufacturing sectors outside of China are facing renewed weakness in market conditions, growing global\nexcess capacity, a slowdown in world economic growth, and continued disruptions in supply chains. In\n2023, China exported more steel than the world\u2019s second, third, fourth, and fifth largest steel producers\n(India, Japan, the United States, and Russia) combined. Furthermore, China\u2019s exports from January through\nAugust 2024 were 19 percent higher than during the same period in 2023. Today, China remains by far the\nworld\u2019s largest exporter of steel and steel-intensive products. China\u2019s steel production also remains far\ndirtier in terms of greenhouse gas emissions than the steel production that it displaces in the United States\nand most other countries.", "and most other countries.\nExcess capacity in China\u2019s steel sector boosts the price competitiveness of China\u2019s downstream\nmanufacturing industries in global markets through the provision of artificially low-priced steel inputs. For\nexample, in the shipbuilding sector, steel constitutes a significant percentage of a vessel\u2019s cost. However,\nreports indicate that Chinese steel is substantially cheaper than in market-oriented economies. For example,\nthe OECD has noted that \u201cChinese steel prices are significantly lower than Japanese and European ones\u2026in\nsome periods up to 50% compared to\u2026European prices and 60% lower than Japanese prices.\u201d\nIn its 2023 Results Report, the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, a multilateral body facilitated by\nthe OECD, found that \u201cexcess capacity in the Chinese steel industry is depressing domestic prices for crude\nsteel products and encouraging production and indirect exports of steel-containing goods.\u201d In addition,", "according to the 2023 Results Report, \u201ca situation where steel excess capacity starts to build in downstream\nsectors of the steel market . . . and artificially boost[s] the price competitiveness of those sectors is an\nadditional cause of concern.\u201d Similarly, a study by the OECD reveals that China\u2019s exports of indirect steel\nproducts have increased steadily in the last decade while exports of similar products in major steel-making\neconomies such as India, Japan, and the EU have remained stable or, in the case of the United States and\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 77\nSouth Korea, declined. A rapid increase in Chinese exports of these products in 2017 coincided with a\nsignificant buildup of Chinese capacity and reduction in Chinese direct steel exports, leading the OECD to\nconclude that a substitution effect along the Chinese steel value chain may have taken place. Chinese\nexports of steel-intensive products continued to increase significantly in volume terms over the last five\nyears.", "years.\nState-directed mergers and acquisitions in the Chinese steel sector have been framed by China as a means\nfor increasing efficiency and reducing excess capacity, but instead these measures have contributed to\nexcess capacity. In 2009, the State Council issued the Steel Industry Adjustment and Revitalization Plan,\nwhich set a target of creating five large steel groups controlling 45 percent or more of total national\nproduction capacity, with at least 40 percent of production capacity concentrated along rivers and in coastal\nregions. This industrial plan and other industrial policy measures, including the 14th Five-Year Plan for\nDevelopment of Raw Materials Industries (2021), the Guiding Opinion Regarding Promoting High Quality\nDevelopment in the Steel Industry (2022), and the Work Plan for Stable Growth in the Steel Industry (2023),\nalso refer to \u201ccapacity replacement policy support\u201d for steel producers engaging in mergers and", "also refer to \u201ccapacity replacement policy support\u201d for steel producers engaging in mergers and\nreorganizations. This policy support effectively exempted these enterprises from otherwise stated\nprohibitions on new projects without elimination of an equal or greater amount of existing capacity.\nDespite an acknowledgement by the State Council of the significant growth in \u201csurplus production\ncapacity\u201d in China\u2019s steel sector as far back as 2009, China\u2019s crude steelmaking capacity continued to\nincrease, rising from 980 million metric tons in 2009 to 1.142 billion metric tons in 2023. During this\nperiod, China\u2019s state-owned steel producers increased production and market shares, both in the China\nmarket and in global markets. In addition, between 2009 and 2023, the shares of domestic crude steel\nproduction and global crude steel production attributable to the top four state-owned steel producers in", "China alone increased from 14.1 percent to 25.8 percent and from 6.5 percent to 13.9 percent, respectively.\nSimilarly, primary aluminum production capacity in China increased by more than 1,600 percent between\n2000 and 2023, with China accounting for 80 percent of global capacity growth during that period. China\u2019s\nexpansion of production capacity has driven price declines globally, but even with these low prices, China\nhas continued to expand its production capacity. Much of this additional capacity has been built with\ngovernment support and relies on GHG emissions-intensive sources of electricity. China\u2019s primary\naluminum capacity accounts for 57 percent of global capacity and is more than double the capacity of the\nnext eight aluminum-producing countries combined. As in the steel sector, China\u2019s aluminum production\nhas also ballooned in recent years, as China\u2019s aluminum production has continued to increase despite", "domestic and global demand shocks. China\u2019s capacity and production continue to contribute to major\nimbalances and price distortions in global markets, harming U.S. and allied aluminum producers and\nworkers.\nIn China\u2019s shipbuilding sector, non-market policies and practices have led to a significant build up in excess\ncapacity, undercutting foreign competition and consolidating China\u2019s dominant position globally. In a 2021\nreport, the OECD found that entry subsidies provided by the Chinese Government attracted inefficient\nenterprises and led to market fragmentation and excess capacity in the shipbuilding sector, while the\nintroduction of production and investment subsidies in combination with sub-optimal exit strategies for\ninefficient enterprises exacerbated these outcomes. As a result, Chinese shipbuilders increased their share\nof all merchant tonnage produced globally from 5 percent in 1999 to over 50 percent in 2023, increasing", "China\u2019s ownership of the global commercial fleet to 19 percent, while securing control of 95 percent of\nshipping containers and 86 percent of the world\u2019s supply of intermodal chassis, among other components\nand products.\nExcess capacity in China hurts various U.S. industries and workers not only through direct exports from\nChina to the United States, but also through its impact on global prices and supply and through indirect\n78 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\ntrade of steel and aluminum-intensive products, which makes it difficult for competitive manufacturers\nthroughout the world to remain viable. Indeed, domestic industries in many of China\u2019s trading partners\ncontinue to petition their respective governments to impose trade measures to respond to the trade-distortive\neffects of China\u2019s excess capacity. In addition, the United States has acted under Section 232 of the Trade\nExpansion Act of 1962 to impose additional duties on steel, aluminum, and derivative steel and aluminum", "products after finding that these products are being imported into the United States in such quantities and\nunder such circumstances as to threaten to impair U.S. national security. In the United States\u2019 view, in the\nabsence of efforts to redress China\u2019s anticompetitive behavior, the risk is that steel and aluminum producers\nin the United States and many other countries with market-oriented economies will be forced to close,\nwhich would, among other things, create even greater dependencies on China.\nOver the past year, the world has been reminded that the non-market policies and practices that emanate\nfrom China\u2019s state-led industrial plans often generate severe and persistent excess capacity, sometimes even\nwhen China is not targeting a particular industry for domestic and global dominance. At present, the world\nis seeing excess capacity emerge in more and more Chinese industries in a dynamic that economists are", "labeling \u201cChina Shock 2.0.\u201d Faced with an acute crisis in the real estate sector and struggling manufacturers\ncoming out of the COVID pandemic, governments at all levels in China have increased their financial and\nregulatory support for manufacturers in traditional industries like steel, aluminum, household appliances,\nfertilizers, and machine tools, as well as for manufacturers in emerging, high technology industries. These\ninterventions have led to production well in excess of domestic demand in many sectors, and, in some\nsectors, such as solar, three or four times the level of global demand. In all of these sectors, with domestic\ndemand in China remaining weak, a wide range of low-priced manufactured goods have been flooding\nexport markets. As discussed above, given China\u2019s economic size as the second largest economy in the\nworld and the largest trader among WTO Members, China\u2019s excess capacity has global implications, and", "those implications are broadly negative for China\u2019s trading partners, as the world is seeing with China\nShock 2.0.\nANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES\nAs previously reported, China\u2019s implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law has generated various\nconcerns. A key concern is the extent to which the Anti-Monopoly Law is applied to state-owned\nenterprises. While Chinese regulatory authorities have clarified that the Anti-Monopoly Law does apply to\nstate-owned enterprises, they have brought enforcement actions primarily against provincial government-\nlevel state-owned enterprises, rather than central government-level state-owned enterprises under the\nsupervision of SASAC. Moreover, the enforcement actions that do take place, along with any\ncorresponding penalties imposed, are not open and transparent to the public. In addition, provisions in the\nAnti-Monopoly Law protect the lawful operations of state-owned enterprises and government monopolies\nin industries deemed nationally important.", "in industries deemed nationally important.\nAnother key concern relates to how the Anti-Monopoly Law is applied to foreign companies. Many U.S.\ncompanies have cited selective enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Law against foreign companies seeking\nto do business in China as a major concern, and they have highlighted in particular the comparatively limited\nenforcement of this law against state-owned enterprises.\nStill another concern expressed by U.S. industry relates to how draft implementing rules for the Anti-\nMonopoly Law define anti-competitive behavior in the development of standards and the licensing and\nimplementation of standards-essential patents. U.S. industry is concerned that Anti-Monopoly Law\nenforcement will be misused for the purpose of depressing the value of foreign-owned IP in key\ntechnologies, including by finding Anti-Monopoly Law violations with regard to the licensing of patents in\nthe absence of actual harm to competition or the competitive process.", "the absence of actual harm to competition or the competitive process.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 79\nU.S. industry has also expressed serious concern about insufficient predictability, due process, and\ntransparency in Anti-Monopoly Law investigative processes of foreign companies. For example, U.S.\nindustry reports that, through the threat of steep fines and other penalties, China\u2019s regulatory authorities\nhave pressured foreign companies to \u201ccooperate\u201d in the face of unspecified allegations and have\ndiscouraged or prevented foreign companies from bringing counsel to meetings. In addition, U.S.\ncompanies continue to report that the Chinese regulatory authorities sometimes make \u201cinformal\u201d\nsuggestions regarding appropriate company behavior, including how a company is to behave outside China,\nstrongly suggesting that a failure to comply may result in investigations and possible punishment. More\nrecently, high-level policy statements suggest increased Anti-Monopoly Law enforcement where", "recently, high-level policy statements suggest increased Anti-Monopoly Law enforcement where\ntechnology owned or controlled by foreign companies allegedly implicates national security concerns or\nimplicates technology being prioritized for indigenous innovation in China.\nGiven the state-led nature of China\u2019s economy, the need for careful scrutiny of anticompetitive government\nrestraints and regulation is high. The Anti-Monopoly Law\u2019s provisions on the abuse of administrative (i.e.,\ngovernment) power are potentially important instruments for reducing the government\u2019s interference in\nmarkets and for promoting the establishment and maintenance of increasingly competitive markets in\nChina. The State Council\u2019s adoption of the Opinions on Establishing a Fair Competition Review System\nin 2016 reflected a widening of oversight by China\u2019s anti-monopoly enforcement agencies over undue\ngovernment restraints on competition and anticompetitive regulation of competition. Increased oversight", "in this area was also reflected in the amendments to the Anti-Monopoly Law in 2022, which included a new\nchapter regarding the abuse of administrative monopoly. The SAMR has since issued draft rules regarding\nthe abuse of administrative monopoly, and SAMR has also identified the elimination of administrative\nmonopolies as an enforcement priority. It remains to be seen whether SAMR will have sufficient authority\nand resources to implement this enforcement priority robustly.\nSTATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES\nWhile many provisions in China\u2019s WTO accession agreement indirectly discipline the activities of state-\nowned and state-invested enterprises, China also agreed to some specific disciplines. In particular, it agreed\nthat laws, regulations, and other measures relating to the purchase of goods or services for commercial sale\nby state-owned and state-invested enterprises, or relating to the production of goods or supply of services", "for commercial sale or for non-governmental purposes by state-owned and state-invested enterprises, would\nbe subject to certain specified WTO rules. China also affirmatively agreed that state-owned and state-\ninvested enterprises would have to make purchases and sales based solely on commercial considerations,\nsuch as price, quality, marketability, and availability, and that the Chinese Government would not directly\nor indirectly influence the commercial decisions of state-owned and state-invested enterprises. In addition,\nChina agreed that enterprises of other WTO Members would have an adequate opportunity to compete for\nsales to and purchases from state-owned and invested enterprises on non-discriminatory terms and\nconditions.\nIn subsequent bilateral dialogues with the United States, China made further commitments. In particular,\nChina committed to develop a market environment of fair competition for enterprises of all kinds of", "China committed to develop a market environment of fair competition for enterprises of all kinds of\nownership and to provide them with non-discriminatory treatment in terms of credit provision, taxation\nincentives, and regulatory policies.\nHowever, instead of adopting measures giving effect to its commitments, China took steps intended to\nstrengthen the role of state-owned and state-invested enterprises in the economy and to protect them against\nforeign competition. China established the SASAC and adopted the Law on State-owned Assets of\nEnterprises, in addition to numerous other measures that mandate state ownership and control of many\n80 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nimportant industrial sectors. The CCP also ensured itself a decisive role in state-owned and state-invested\nenterprises\u2019 major business decisions, personnel changes, project arrangements, and movement of funds.\nThe fundamental premise of these measures is to enable the Chinese Government and the CCP to intervene", "in the business strategies, management, and investments of these enterprises in order to ensure that they\nplay a dominant role in the national economy in line with the overall objective of developing China\u2019s\n\u201csocialist market economy\u201d and China\u2019s plans for industrial domination. Over the past few years, Party\nleadership in state-owned and state-invested enterprises has been strengthened through practices such as\nappointing a person as both the chairman of the board and the Party secretary for a state-owned enterprise\nand requiring the establishment of party committees in state-owned enterprises.\nIn its 2013 Third Plenum Decision, China endorsed a number of far-reaching economic reform\npronouncements, which called for making the market \u201cdecisive\u201d in allocating resources, reducing Chinese\nGovernment intervention in the economy, accelerating China\u2019s opening up to foreign goods and services", "and improving transparency and the rule of law to allow fair competition in China\u2019s market. It also called\nfor \u201creforming\u201d China\u2019s state-owned and state-invested enterprises.\nHowever, rather than actually embrace the role of the market, China sought to strengthen the role of the\nstate in the economy, including the role of state-owned enterprises in the economy. Statements by China\u2019s\nPresident also made clear that China continues to view the role of the state very differently from the United\nStates and other market economies. In October 2016, China\u2019s President called for strengthening the role\nof the CCP in state-owned enterprises and emphasized that state-owned enterprises should be \u201cimportant\nforces\u201d to implement national strategies and enhance national power. More broadly, in February 2019, in\nan article in a CCP journal, China\u2019s President further called for the strengthening of the Party\u2019s \u201cleadership", "over the rule of law,\u201d and he vowed that China \u201cmust never copy the models or practices of other countries\u201d\nand \u201cwe must never follow the path of Western \u2018constitutionalism,\u2019 \u2018separation of powers\u2019 or \u2018judicial\nindependence.\u2019\u201d\nWith regard to the reform of China\u2019s state-owned enterprises, one example of China\u2019s efforts included an\nannouncement that China would classify these enterprises into commercial, strategic, or public interest\ncategories and require commercial state-owned and state-invested enterprises to garner reasonable returns\non capital. However, this plan also allowed for divergence from commercially driven results to meet\nbroadly construed national security interests, including energy and resource interests and cyber and\ninformation security interests. In recent years, China has also sought to strengthen the role of its state-\nowned enterprises in a number of sectors through mergers to create larger, consolidated, and more powerful", "enterprises, while also increasing the investment of state capital into sectors that the state deems strategic.\nSimilarly, in recent years, China has pursued reforms through efforts to realize \u201cmixed ownership.\u201d These\nefforts included largely unsuccessful attempts to pressure private companies to invest in, or merge with,\nstate-owned and state-invested enterprises as a way to inject innovative practices into and create new\nopportunities for inefficient state-owned and state-invested enterprises. Plainly, none of these various\nreforms have strengthened the role of the market. Rather, they have strengthened the role of state-owned\nenterprises in the economy while directing increasing amounts of state capital toward certain industries,\nincluding those specified in Made in China 2025, in pursuit of China\u2019s industrial domination objectives.\nPreviously, China had also indicated that it would consider adopting the principle of \u201ccompetitive", "Previously, China had also indicated that it would consider adopting the principle of \u201ccompetitive\nneutrality\u201d for state-owned enterprises. However, China has continued to pursue policies that further\nenshrine the dominant role of the state and its industrial plans when it comes to the operation of state-owned\nand state-invested enterprises. For example, China has adopted rules ensuring that the Chinese Government\ncontinues to have full authority over how state-owned and state-invested enterprises use allocations of state\ncapital and over the projects that state-owned enterprises pursue.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 81\nOverall, while China\u2019s efforts at times have appeared to signal a high-level determination to accelerate\nneeded economic reforms, those reforms have not materialized. Indeed, the Chinese Government\u2019s role in\nthe economy has only increased. It also seems clear that China\u2019s past policy initiatives were not designed", "to reduce the presence of state-owned and state-invested enterprises in China\u2019s economy or to force them\nto compete on the same terms as private commercial operators. Rather, the reform objectives were to\nstrengthen state-owned and state-invested enterprises through consolidation, increased access to state\ncapital, preferential access to goods and services and the use of other non-market policies and practices\ndesigned to give these enterprises unfair competitive advantages, both in China and globally.\nThis unfair situation is made worse for foreign companies. Like China\u2019s state-owned and state-invested\nenterprises, China\u2019s private companies also benefit from a wide array of state intervention and support\ndesigned to promote the development of China\u2019s domestic industries in accordance with China\u2019s industrial\ndomination objectives. These interventions and support are deployed in concert with other non-market", "policies and practices that restrict, take advantage of, discriminate against, or otherwise create\ndisadvantages for foreign companies and their technologies, products, and services.\nLABOR\nThe Chinese Government represses internationally recognized labor rights and fails to adequately enforce\nexisting prohibitions on forced labor. China has been the subject of international attention for its forced\nlabor practices, especially in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), where China has\narbitrarily detained more than one million Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities. Victims, news\nmedia, and think tanks report that factories frequently engage in coercive recruitment, limit workers\u2019\nfreedom of movement and communication, and subject workers to constant surveillance, retribution for\nreligious beliefs, exclusion from community and social life, and isolation. It is currently estimated that", "hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other Muslim minority groups are\nbeing subjected to forced labor in China following detention. Based on the U.S. Government\u2019s independent\nanalysis of these sources, the U.S. Government has taken several actions to address forced labor and other\nhuman rights abuses in the XUAR.\nOver the years, the Customs and Border Protection of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has issued\nseveral withhold release orders (WROs) pursuant to Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 based on\ninformation that reasonably indicates the use of detainee or prison labor and situations of forced labor in\nthe XUAR. One of them, issued in January 2021, was a region-wide WRO on cotton and tomato products\nand all downstream goods containing those products.\nIn July 2020, the United States issued a Xinjiang Supply Chain Business Advisory for U.S. businesses", "whose supply chains run through the XUAR. The United States updated this advisory in July 2021. As\nupdated, the advisory calls urgent attention to U.S. businesses\u2019 supply chain risks and identifies investing\nand sourcing considerations for businesses and individuals with exposure to entities engaged in forced labor\nand other human rights abuses linked to the XUAR. The advisory also describes U.S. Government actions\ntaken to counter the use of forced labor in the XUAR and to prohibit the importation of goods produced in\nwhole or in part with forced labor or convict labor. In September 2023, the United States issued an\naddendum to the updated advisory to further highlight reports on state-sponsored forced labor and human\nrights abuses in the XUAR as well as to stress the urgency for businesses to undertake appropriate due\ndiligence measures.\nIn December 2021, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) entered into force. Among other", "In December 2021, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) entered into force. Among other\nthings, it established a rebuttable presumption that the importation of goods from the XUAR is prohibited\nunder Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. This rebuttable presumption took effect in June 2022.\n82 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nThe United States also published a UFLPA Enforcement Strategy in June 2022 and subsequently published\nupdates in August 2023 and July 2024. This Enforcement Strategy takes into account input received from\nprivate individuals, industry associations, consultancy and risk-management companies, civil society\norganizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions, and others who shared their views\non potential measures to prevent the importation into the United States of goods mined, produced, or\nmanufactured wholly or in part with forced labor in China. The main components of the Enforcement", "manufactured wholly or in part with forced labor in China. The main components of the Enforcement\nStrategy include: (1) an assessment of the risk of importing goods made with forced labor in China, (2) the\ndevelopment of the UFLPA Entity List and descriptions of forced-labor schemes, (3) recommendations for\nefforts, initiatives, and tools to identify and trace the origin of goods, (4) a description of relevant legal\nauthorities and tools to prevent entry of violative goods, (5) a description of resources, (6) the development\nof importer guidance, and (7) the development of a coordination plan with NGOs and the private sector.\nThe Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force (FLETF) member agencies, including USTR, have been\nworking to compile and update the UFLPA Entity List, a consolidated register of four distinct lists,\nincluding: (1) a list of entities in the XUAR that mine, produce, or manufacture wholly or in part any goods,", "wares, articles, and merchandise with forced labor; (2) a list of entities that work with the government\nauthorities of the XUAR to recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, or receive forced labor or Uyghurs, Kazakhs,\nKyrgyz or members of other persecuted groups out of the XUAR; (3) a list of entities that export products\nmined, produced, or manufactured by entities in lists 1 or 2 above from China into the United States; and\n(4) a list of facilities and entities, including the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, that source\nmaterial from the XUAR or from persons working with the government in the XUAR or the Xinjiang\nProduction and Construction Corps for purposes of the \u201cpoverty alleviation\u201d program or the \u201cpairing\nassistance\u201d program or any other government labor scheme that uses forced labor. As of December 31,\n2024, over 100 entities had been added by the U.S. Government to the UFLPA Entity List.", "2024, over 100 entities had been added by the U.S. Government to the UFLPA Entity List.\nThere is no evidence that China has taken any steps toward eliminating forced labor practices and human\nrights abuses in the XUAR. Indeed, China\u2019s initial response was to conduct raids and impose significant\nrestrictions on U.S. and other foreign consulting companies in China that provide due diligence for foreign\ninvestors. Subsequently, China began retaliating against multinational companies that have heeded the\nXinjiang Business Advisory and complied with the UFLPA Enforcement Strategy, particularly when these\ncompanies have announced their plans publicly. For example, China has actively discouraged Chinese\nconsumers from purchasing the products made by several of these companies China even initiated an\ninvestigation into one large U.S. apparel company for \u201cviolating normal market trading practices\u201d because", "this company made a public pledge to move its cotton sourcing out of the XUAR. Depending on its\noutcome, this retaliatory investigation could potentially result in the company being placed on China\u2019s so-\ncalled \u201cUnreliable Entity List\u201d and being subjected to penalties.\nSeparately, in June 2022, the President issued the Memorandum on Combating Illegal, Unreported, and\nUnregulated Fishing (IUU) and Associated Labor Abuses. This Memorandum notes that, if left unchecked,\nIUU fishing and associated labor abuses threaten the livelihoods and human rights of fishers around the\nworld and will undermine U.S. economic competitiveness, national security, and fishery sustainability. In\nDecember 2022, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned individuals associated with China\u2019s distant\nwater fishing vessels for serious human rights abuse, including forced labor, of workers aboard these\nvessels.\nIt also remains concerning that China does not adhere to certain other internationally recognized labor", "standards, including freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.\nChinese law provides for the right to associate and form a union, but does not allow workers to form or join\nan independent union of their own choosing. Unions must affiliate with the official All-China Federation\nof Trade Unions (ACFTU), which is under the direction of the CCP. Workers at enterprises in China are\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 83\nrequired to accept the ACFTU as their representative. They cannot instead select another union or decide\nnot to have any union representation. Only collective bargaining through the ACFTU is permitted, and\nthere is no legal obligation for an employer to bargain in good faith. Striking is also prohibited.\nENVIRONMENT\nEffect of Import Ban on Scrap Materials, Recyclable Materials, and on Recycling Markets\nCurrently, China restricts almost all imports of unprocessed scrap and recyclable materials. China only", "allows imports of certain processed materials, including \u201crecycled raw materials\u201d such as copper, steel,\naluminum and brass that meet purity standards, pelletized scrap plastic, and pulped scrap paper. These\nrestrictions have contributed to increased costs for recycling in the United States and the decisions by some\ncommunities to terminate some of their recycling programs. Because China was previously such a large\ndestination market, significant amounts of U.S. scrap materials are being redirected to landfills or\nincinerators.\nSince 2017, China has issued numerous measures that limit or ban imports of most scrap and recovered\nmaterials, such as certain types of plastic, paper, and metals. China has also employed import licensing and\ninspection measures to restrict imports of scrap materials. Notably, China does not universally apply similar\nrestrictions to domestic processers of domestically sourced scrap and recovered materials.", "restrictions to domestic processers of domestically sourced scrap and recovered materials.\nIn 2020, China amended the Law on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution by Solid Waste.\nAccording to this amended law, the intent is to reduce imports of solid waste essentially to zero.\nU.S. exports to China of the unprocessed scrap and recovered materials covered by China\u2019s restrictive\nmeasures totaled $479 million in 2016, the year before China started to pursue its more restrictive policies.\nSince then, U.S. exports of these materials to China have been significantly reduced.\nIn addition to impacting the global market for scrap and recovered materials, the tightened restrictions have\nraised the costs of recycling in the United States, as exporters seek domestic processing facilities or\ninternational buyers. Additionally, other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, have introduced their", "own regulatory changes that in some ways parallel the changes in China\u2019s import regime, such as by setting\nimpossibly high purity standards for recyclable materials, imposing new import licensing requirements and\nrequiring pre-shipment and post-shipment inspections. As a result, significant amounts of U.S. scrap\nmaterials and recyclable materials have not found new buyers, leading to increased landfilling, incineration,\nand air pollution and increased demand for virgin materials globally.\nImport Ban on Remanufactured Products\nChina prohibits the importation of remanufactured products, which it typically classifies as used goods.\nChina also maintains restrictions that prevent remanufacturing process inputs (known as cores) from being\nimported into China\u2019s customs territory, except special economic zones. These import prohibitions and\nrestrictions undermine the development of industries in many sectors in China, including mining,", "restrictions undermine the development of industries in many sectors in China, including mining,\nagriculture, healthcare, transportation, and communications, because companies in these industries are\nunable to purchase high-quality, lower-cost remanufactured products produced outside of China.\nNevertheless, China is apparently prepared to pay this price in order to limit imports of remanufactured\ngoods.\n84 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nOTHER BARRIERS\nExport Restraints\nOver the years, China has deployed a combination of export restraints, including export quotas, export\nlicensing, minimum export prices, export duties, and other restrictions, on a number of raw material inputs\nwhere it holds the leverage of being among the world\u2019s leading producers. In many instances, through\nthese export restraints, it appears that China has been able to provide substantial economic advantages to a\nwide range of downstream producers in China at the expense of foreign downstream producers, while", "wide range of downstream producers in China at the expense of foreign downstream producers, while\ncreating pressure on foreign downstream producers to move their operations, technologies, and jobs to\nChina.\nIn 2013, China removed its export quotas and duties on several raw material inputs of key interest to the\nU.S. steel, aluminum, and chemicals industries after the United States won a dispute against China at the\nWTO. In 2014, the United States won a second WTO dispute, focusing on China\u2019s export restraints on rare\nearths, tungsten, and molybdenum, which are key inputs for a multitude of U.S.-made products, including\nhybrid automobile batteries, wind turbines, energy-efficient lighting, steel, advanced electronics,\nautomobiles, petroleum, and chemicals. China removed those export restraints in 2015. In 2016, the United\nStates launched a third WTO dispute challenging export restraints maintained by China. The challenged", "export restraints include export quotas and export duties maintained by China on various forms of 11 raw\nmaterials, including antimony, chromium, cobalt, copper, graphite, indium, lead, magnesia, talc, tantalum,\nand tin. These raw materials are key inputs in important U.S. manufacturing industries, including\naerospace, automotive, construction, and electronics. While China appears to have removed the challenged\nexport restraints, the United States has continued to monitor the situation and finds it deeply concerning\nthat the United States needed to bring multiple disputes to address the same WTO compliance issues.\nA newer concern involves China\u2019s expanding regulation of rare earths. Since November 2023, China has\nbeen requiring exporters to provide detailed reporting on transactions involving rare earths. In addition, in\nJune 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued the Regulations on the", "June 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued the Regulations on the\nAdministration of Rare Earths, which covers the mining, refining and separation, metal smelting, and usage\nof rare earths. The regulations mandate a detailed \u201ctracing\u201d system to track the mining, production, refining,\ntransfer, and end-use of rare earths. Foreshadowing possible future regulation of rare earths under China\u2019s\nexport control regime, this measure also provides that rare earth exporters need to abide by laws and\nregulations in the area of export controls.\nOver the last two years, China has been ramping up its use of export controls and various designation lists\nto target the supply chains of the United States and its allies, as China has weaponized its export controls,\nprimarily targeting the U.S. defense industrial base and critical minerals that have wide-ranging commercial", "uses. China began applying its export control regime to various critical minerals in 2023 by requiring\nexport licenses for products containing gallium, germanium, and graphite, followed by antimony and\nproducts and technologies essential to the production of superhard materials in 2024. China has tied the\nbasis for these export controls to national security and international nonproliferation obligations. However,\nmany of the export controls are broadly scoped and encumber legitimate commercial trade. China\u2019s legal\nregime also provides for the extraterritorial reach of the export controls, creating potential downstream\nimpact. In addition, under the 2020 Export Control Law, China explicitly authorizes the imposition of\nexport controls as a retaliatory measure against countries determined to be harming China\u2019s national\nsecurity or interests.\nIn November 2021, China announced an export ban on certain fertilizers. In June 2024, China imposed", "In November 2021, China announced an export ban on certain fertilizers. In June 2024, China imposed\nfurther export restrictions on fertilizers. Despite repeated requests from its trading partners to lift this export\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 85\nban and help address growing international concern over rising commodity prices and disrupted global\nsupply chains, China continues to impose this export ban.\nFinally, since 2002, China has maintained a distinct administrative system for control over technology\ntransfer under the Regulation on the Administration of Technology Import and Export. The technology\ntransfer control regime established by this measure governs the overseas transfer of technologies by trade,\ninvestment, or economic or technological cooperation and includes intellectual property, licensing, trade\nsecrets, and technology services of technologies listed in the Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and", "Restricted from Export, which was most recently updated in December 2023. Technologies that are\n\u201cprohibited\u201d cannot be exported, while \u201crestricted\u201d technologies require a license for export. Unlike the\nExport Control Law, which aims to safeguard \u201cnational security and interests\u201d and to ensure \u201cnon-\nproliferation and other international obligations,\u201d the stated goal of the Regulation on the Administration\nof Technology Import and Export is \u201cenhancing the national economic growth and scientific development.\u201d\nThe Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted from Export prohibits or restricts the export of\nan array of technologies in areas such as rare earth extraction and separation, cryptography, and traditional\nChinese medicine processing.\nValue-Added Tax Rebates and Related Policies\nAs in prior years, in 2024, the Chinese Government attempted to manage the export of many primary,", "As in prior years, in 2024, the Chinese Government attempted to manage the export of many primary,\nintermediate, and downstream products by raising or lowering the VAT rebate available upon export. China\nsometimes reinforces its objectives by imposing or retracting export duties. These practices have caused\ntremendous disruption, uncertainty, and unfairness in the global markets for some products, particularly\ndownstream products for which China is a leading world producer or exporter, such as products made by\nthe steel, aluminum, and soda ash industries. These practices, together with other policies, such as excessive\ngovernment subsidization, have also contributed to severe excess capacity in these same industries.\nAn apparently positive development took place at the July 2014 S&ED meeting, when China committed to\nimprove its VAT rebate system, including by actively studying international best practices, and to deepen", "communication with the United States on this matter, including regarding its impact on trade. Once more,\nhowever, this promise remains unfulfilled. China has not made any movement toward the adoption of\ninternational best practices.\nTrade Remedies\nAs of December 31, 2024, China had 11 ongoing antidumping investigations and 108 antidumping\nmeasures in place, affecting imports from 17 countries or regions. China also had one ongoing\ncountervailing duty investigation and four countervailing duty measures in place, affecting imports from\ntwo countries or regions. In addition, China had one ongoing safeguard investigation.\nThe most significant systemic shortcomings in China\u2019s antidumping and countervailing duty practice\ncontinue to be in the areas of transparency and due process. Over the years, China has often utilized\nantidumping and countervailing duty investigations as more of a retaliatory tool than as a mechanism to", "nullify the effects of dumping or unfair subsidization within its domestic market. In response, the United\nStates has pressed China bilaterally, in WTO meetings and through written comments submitted in\nconnection with pending antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings to adhere strictly to WTO rules\nin the conduct of its trade remedy investigations.\nThe conduct of antidumping investigations by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) continues to\nfall short of full commitment to the fundamental tenets of transparency and procedural fairness embodied\nin the WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n86 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\n1994, commonly known as the Antidumping Agreement. The United States and other WTO Members\naccordingly have expressed concerns about key lapses in transparency and due process in China\u2019s conduct\nof antidumping investigations. The principal areas of concern include: MOFCOM\u2019s inadequate disclosure", "of key documents placed on the record by domestic Chinese producers; insufficient disclosures of the\nessential facts underlying MOFCOM decisions, such as dumping margin calculations and evidence\nsupporting injury and dumping conclusions; MOFCOM\u2019s failure to issue supplemental questionnaires in\ninstances where MOFCOM identifies information deficiencies; the improper rejection of U.S. respondents\u2019\nreported cost and sales data; the unjustified use of facts available; and MOFCOM\u2019s failure to adequately\naddress critical arguments or evidence put forward by interested parties. These aspects of China\u2019s\nantidumping practice have been raised with MOFCOM in numerous proceedings at the WTO over the past\nseveral years.\nIn certain past antidumping investigations of U.S. imports, China has determined \u2013 without legal or factual\nsupport \u2013 that costs and prices in certain U.S. markets are distorted, and therefore unusable, because of so-", "called \u201cnon-market situations.\u201d China is again exploring whether a \u201cnon-market situation\u201d exists in certain\nU.S. energy sectors in its ongoing antidumping investigation of polyoxymethylene copolymer from the\nUnited States. A preliminary determination in this investigation is expected in early 2025.\nA review of China\u2019s conduct of countervailing duty investigations makes clear that, as in the antidumping\narea, China has failed to adequately improve its transparency and due process when conducting these\ninvestigations. In addition, the United States has noted procedural concerns specific to China\u2019s conduct of\ncountervailing duty investigations. For example, in recent years, China has initiated investigations of\nalleged subsidies that raised concerns, given the requirements regarding \u201csufficient evidence\u201d in Article\n11.2 of the Subsidies Agreement. The United States is also concerned about China\u2019s application of facts\navailable under Article 12.7 of the Subsidies Agreement.", "available under Article 12.7 of the Subsidies Agreement.\nOn several occasions in the past, the United States has expressed serious concerns about China\u2019s pursuit of\nantidumping and countervailing duty remedies that appear to be retaliatory and intended to discourage the\nUnited States and other trading partners from the legitimate exercise of their rights under WTO antidumping\nand countervailing duty rules and the trade remedy provisions of China\u2019s accession agreement. It also\nappears that China has used arbitrary economic and trade measures, including antidumping and\ncountervailing duty investigations, as a form of economic coercion designed to achieve China\u2019s political\ngoals. The antidumping and countervailing duties that China imposed on imports of Australian barley in\n2021 and the antidumping duties that China imposed on imports of Australian wine in 2021 are two obvious\nexamples of this tactic, as China used them to express dissatisfaction with political statements and actions", "taken by the Australian government. More recently, in 2024, China launched antidumping investigations\nof imports of brandy, pork, and dairy products from the EU as the EU\u2019s anti-subsidy investigation of\nChinese electric vehicle imports proceeded.\nIn certain recent investigations of U.S. imports, China has also made determinations without legal or factual\nsupport. For example, in the final countervailing duty determination on imports of n-propanol from the\nUnited States, China found that alleged subsidies to the U.S. oil and gas sector automatically passed through\nto petrochemical products without providing the analysis required by the Subsidies Agreement.\nPharmaceuticals\nFor several years, the United States has pressed China on a range of pharmaceuticals issues. These issues\nhave related to matters such as overly restrictive patent application examination practices, regulatory\napprovals that are delayed or linked to extraneous criteria, weak protections against the unfair commercial", "use and unauthorized disclosure of regulatory data, issues with the implementation of an efficient\nmechanism to resolve patent infringement disputes, requirements to share ownership with a Chinese partner\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 87\nof patent rights arising from research generated by using human genetic resources in China, and\nimplementation of patent term extensions for unreasonable marketing approval delays, including limits on\nthe type of protection provided. While China has implemented some helpful reforms, the United States\nstill has many of the same concerns with China\u2019s pharmaceutical market, especially as it pertains to\ntreatment of foreign companies.\nIn its WTO accession agreement, China committed to provide effective protection against unfair\ncommercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing\napproval for pharmaceutical products. To provide this protection, known as regulatory data protection", "(RDP), China committed to enact laws and regulations to ensure that no person, other than the submitter of\nthe data, could rely on the submitted data in a product approval application without permission from the\nsubmitter for six years from the date on which China granted marketing approval to the submitter.\nIn 2017, CFDA finally issued several draft notices addressing the issue of RDP. These draft notices set out\na conceptual framework to protect against the unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of\nundisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products, and they\nalso sought to promote the efficient resolution of patent disputes between right holders and the producers\nof generic pharmaceuticals. However, the proposed framework did not provide for a six-year period of\nRDP despite the commitment that China had made in its WTO accession agreement in 2001.", "RDP despite the commitment that China had made in its WTO accession agreement in 2001.\nIn 2018, CFDA\u2019s successor agency, NMPA, issued draft Drug Registration Regulations and draft\nimplementing measures on drug trial data that would preclude or condition the duration of RDP on whether\nclinical trials occur in China and whether marketing approval is sought first in China. Subsequently, China\nissued a revised Drug Administration Law in 2019, followed by NMPA\u2019s revised draft Drug Registration\nRegulations in 2020 and NMPA\u2019s revised draft Drug Administration Law Implementing Regulations in\n2021. Despite the opportunities that these revised draft measures afforded China\u2019s regulatory authorities,\nthe concerning limitations on RDP were not removed, and China still has not created a regulatory\nframework providing for the six-year period of RDP as it had committed to do in 2001.\nSince 2018, volume-based procurement has presented a new market access complication for foreign", "Since 2018, volume-based procurement has presented a new market access complication for foreign\nsuppliers of pharmaceuticals, largely because of the opaque and unpredictable nature of the bidding\nprocesses. In November 2018, a National Drug Centralized Procurement Pilot Scheme was launched.\nThen, in January 2019, the State Council issued a Pilot Plan for National Centralized Drug Procurement\nand Use. In January 2023, China\u2019s National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) published the\n2022 edition of its annual National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), which became effective in March\n2023. U.S. industry also cites the need for increased transparency and greater harmony between national\nand provincial bidding processes as well as a greater emphasis on a competitive, market-based approach to\nevaluating a product\u2019s value and relevant bids. In December 2022, NHSA and CNIPA jointly issued the", "evaluating a product\u2019s value and relevant bids. In December 2022, NHSA and CNIPA jointly issued the\nOpinions on Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights in the Field of Centralized\nPharmaceutical Procurement, which sets out to establish a coordination mechanism to remove patent-\ninfringing drugs from the NRDL, with further implementing measures to follow.\nAs part of the Phase One Agreement, the two sides agreed that China would establish a nationwide\nmechanism for the early resolution of potential pharmaceutical patent disputes that covers both small\nmolecule drugs and biologics, including a cause of action to allow a patent holder to seek expeditious\nremedies before the marketing of an allegedly infringing product. Separately, the agreement also provides\nfor patent term extensions to compensate for unreasonable patent and marketing approval delays that cut\ninto the effective patent term as well as for the use of supplemental data to meet relevant patentability", "criteria for pharmaceutical patent applications. The United States and China agreed to address data\nprotection for pharmaceuticals in future negotiations.\n88 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nIn October 2020, China amended the Patent Law to provide for patent term extensions for unreasonable\npatent and marketing approval delays, and it also added a mechanism for the early resolution of potential\npatent disputes, known as patent linkage. Implementing measures for the patent linkage mechanism were\nissued in July 2021, as NMPA and CNIPA jointly issued the Trial Implementation Measures for the\nMechanism for Early Resolution of Drug Patent Disputes and the Supreme People\u2019s Court issued the\nRegulations on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Civil Patent Disputes\nRelated to Drug Registration Application. In 2021 and 2022, CNIPA issued draft implementing rules for\nthe amended Patent Law and drafts of amendments to the Patent Examination Guidelines. In December", "the amended Patent Law and drafts of amendments to the Patent Examination Guidelines. In December\n2023, China released the final implementing rules for the amended Patent Law.\nAmong other things, the United States and U.S. stakeholders remain concerned about China\u2019s\nimplementation of patent term extensions for unreasonable patent and marketing approval delays, including\nthe limits on the type of protection provided by China\u2019s regulatory framework. The United States and U.S.\nstakeholders also remain concerned about China\u2019s patent linkage mechanism.\nMedical Devices\nFor many years, working closely with U.S. industry, the United States has raised concerns about China\u2019s\npricing and tendering procedures for medical devices and its treatment of imported medical devices.\nNotably, at the November 2015 JCCT meeting, China committed that, in terms of accessing the market, it\nwill give imported medical devices the same treatment as medical devices manufactured or developed", "will give imported medical devices the same treatment as medical devices manufactured or developed\ndomestically. Unfortunately, despite this commitment, China continues to pursue a wide range of policies\nthat direct China\u2019s purchasing authorities to prioritize the procurement of domestic medical devices over\nimported medical devices. In addition, when China allows the procurement of imported medical devices,\nthe applicable regulations often explicitly preference foreign suppliers that agree to transfer their technology\nto Chinese enterprises.\nSeparately, the United States has pressed China\u2019s regulatory authorities to develop sound payment systems\nfor medical devices that are transparent, predictable, and competitive. The United States has also urged\nChina to adequately recognize quality, safety, and the costs of R&D in its approach to procurement policy.\nIn 2019, China\u2019s State Council launched a volume-based procurement (VBP) approach for medical devices", "in a few provinces and municipalities in an attempt to cut healthcare costs. Since then, VBP has become\nfurther engrained in China\u2019s system, with the formation of multi-province and municipal alliances to\nconduct joint procurements under VBP. In 2020, China implemented its first national VBP tender, which\nhas been subsequently followed by additional national tenders. However, U.S. industry reports that the vast\nmajority of VBP tendering activities are occurring at the sub-national level and that future VBP tenders are\nlikely to be led by individual or groups of subnational entities. U.S. industry also reports that pricing for\nsubsequent rounds of the same products under VBP tenders will likely be based on the results from past\ntenders.\nIn practice, China\u2019s VBP approach prioritizes cost over a medical device\u2019s value or quality, inhibiting the\nability of high-quality, cutting-edge exports from the United States and other countries to compete with", "low-cost local alternatives. As the Chinese Government has acknowledged, the price-cutting generated by\nVBP disproportionately impacts foreign medical device manufacturers, whose only option for securing\nsales is to offer their products at unsustainably low prices.\nAccording to U.S. industry stakeholders, if China continues to pursue VBP without significant changes, it\ncould lead to the creation of a sector in which Chinese medical device companies develop monopolies in\nthe manufacture and sale of various low-cost, low-quality medical devices in the China market. This\noutcome would operate to the disadvantage of innovative medical device companies, many of which are\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 89\nforeign companies, and the patients who rely on advanced medical technologies. Reportedly, some of these\nmedical device companies are reducing training to healthcare providers in order to offer the necessary price", "cuts. Overall, given the size of China\u2019s medical device market, China\u2019s VBP approach poses a risk to\ninnovation in the medical device sector and the provision of high-quality medical treatment, not only in the\nChina market but also globally.\nMeanwhile, the Made in China 2025 industrial plan announced by the State Council in 2015 seeks to prop\nup China\u2019s domestic medical device sector through a series of support policies, including targeted funds,\nlocal content guideless, and procurement policies. The goal of these policies is to significantly increase the\nmarket share of domestically owned and domestically manufactured medical devices, and correspondingly\ndecrease market share of foreign medical devices, by 2025. At the same time, some provincial governments\ndirectly subsidize the purchase of domestically manufactured medical devices. Some provincial\ngovernments have also issued guidelines urging medical institutions to prioritize the procurement of local", "medical equipment over imported equipment. In at least one province, the guidelines suggest that only\nimported medical devices for which there is not a domestic replacement will be eligible for procurement.\nAs discussed in more detail in the Government Procurement section above, in December 2024, China\u2019s\nMinistry of Finance issued for public comment the Notice on Matters Concerning Domestic Product\nStandards and Implementation Policies in the Field of Government Procurement (Draft for Comments).\nCurrently, the vast majority of medical devices in China are purchased through government procurement.\nThe United States continues to urge China to make any draft implementing measures public and to provide\na reasonable period for the public to submit comments.\nU.S. industry also reports that while sub-central governments in China have always provided some financial\nsupport to domestic medical devices companies, their support appears to have increased since 2020. U.S.", "industry has noted that this trend could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, China\u2019s first-ever five-\nyear medical equipment industrial plan covering the years 2021 to 2025, the Action Plan to Promote the\nHigh-Quality Development of the Medical Equipment Industry (2023-2025), or possibly all three factors.\nThe United States will monitor this situation closely and will encourage China to be transparent in its\napproach.\nIn August 2024, NMPA published a draft Medical Device Management Law. The draft law appears to\neliminate certain onerous requirements such as requiring home country approvals before an imported\nmedical device can be registered in China. However, the draft law also promises further industrial policy\nsupport for China\u2019s medical device sector, including financial support, which indicates that China\u2019s unfair,\nanti-competitive approach will likely continue. The United States submitted written comments on the draft", "law and will continue to monitor development of the law and any subsequent implementing regulations.\nFinally, in June 2024, MIIT issued new guidance on \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d major technical equipment, and\nseveral provincial and local authorities have subsequently issued measures and related guidance.\nCollectively, these new actions create incentives for procuring medical devices and other technical\nequipment for which the underlying IP is owned by an entity in China. The implications of these new\nmeasures remain unclear, both for U.S. medical device exports and medical devices produced in China\nbased on IP owned by U.S. entities. The United States is monitoring developments closely.\nSocial Credit System\nSince 2014, China has been working to implement a national \u201csocial credit\u201d system for both individuals\nand companies. The implementation of this system is at a more advanced stage for companies versus", "and companies. The implementation of this system is at a more advanced stage for companies versus\nindividuals, as 18-digit \u201cunified social credit codes\u201d are assigned to every domestic and foreign company\n90 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nin China. These 18-digit codes will provide a way for the Chinese Government to track a company\u2019s record\nof administrative and regulatory compliance and generate public credit information. In a report to the 20th\nNational Party Congress in October 2022, the CCP\u2019s General Secretary emphasized the need to refine the\nsocial credit system. Since then, the Chinese Government has continued to take steps to make the social\ncredit system fully operational.\nUnder the corporate social credit system, government records, and market-generated corporate compliance\ndata are collected on every legal entity in China. The collected information contains regulatory and\nadministrative records contributed by at least 44 state agencies and their branch offices across every", "province in China. Previously disparate information relating to a company\u2019s financial records, regulatory\ncompliance, inspection results and other administrative enforcement activities is being consolidated under\na company\u2019s unified social credit code. All of this data will be aggregated and shared between regulatory\nagencies via the National Credit Information Sharing Platform. Reportedly, approximately 75 percent of\nthe records collected on companies is intended to be designated as \u201copen to the public,\u201d while the remaining\n25 percent that is intended to be withheld will include potentially sensitive information, such as approval\nrecords related to national development projects and details of any criminal cases.\nNationwide data collection under the corporate social credit system provides mechanisms to penalize\ncompanies with poor corporate and legal compliance records by, among other things, subjecting them to", "public censure, while rewarding compliant companies with positive incentives. Negative ratings or\nplacement on a government agency\u2019s censure list can lead to various restrictions on a company\u2019s business\nactivities. A company could face increased inspections, reduced access to loans and tax incentives,\nrestrictions on government procurement, reduced land-use rights, monetary fines or permit denials, among\nother possible penalties.\nCurrently, however, there is no fully integrated national system for assigning comprehensive social credit\nscores for companies, and the social credit system remains highly fragmented. Certain central government\nagencies and sub-central government agencies maintain their own rating systems, with each agency making\nits own decisions about the types of transgressions that warrant negative ratings or placing a company on a\ncensure list.\nIn November 2022, NDRC and PBOC jointly published a draft Social Credit Construction Law that would", "In November 2022, NDRC and PBOC jointly published a draft Social Credit Construction Law that would\ngive the social credit system a legal basis, further embedding it into China\u2019s regulatory network. The draft\nlaw seeks to establish NDRC and PBOC as the main government agencies for construction of the social\ncredit system. Their responsibilities would include overall coordination, supervision and guidance of the\nconstruction of the social credit system, and taking the lead in organizing the formulation and\nimplementation of relevant policies and standards. The draft law also seeks to provide formal legal\ndefinitions for certain terms used in implementing the social credit system, such as \u201cuntrustworthy,\u201d \u201ccredit\nsupervision,\u201d and \u201ccredit information.\u201d In addition, the draft law seeks to codify the protection of certain\nrights, as it calls for the establishment of a social credit system that maintains the security of social credit", "information and strictly protects state secrets, business secrets, and personal privacy, while also protecting\nthe lawful rights and interests of natural persons, legal persons, and unincorporated organizations. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, the draft law had not been issued in final form.\nEarlier in 2022, prior to the publication of the draft law, NDRC issued a draft update of the 2021 National\nBasic Catalogue of Public Credit Information and a draft update of the 2021 National Basic List of\nDisciplinary Measures against Dishonest Acts. The draft Catalogue of Public Credit Information compiles\nthe scope and types of credit information that can be collected by government agencies. It also stipulates\nthat certain categories of information are exempt from collection, including state secrets and trade secrets.\nThe draft List of Disciplinary Measures includes a range of punitive actions that may be applied to violators", "of trust, such as duties, fees, restrictions on market activity, prohibitions, or limitations on occupations and\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 91\nbans from government procurement bidding. Like the draft law, neither the draft Catalogue of Public Credit\nInformation nor the draft List of Disciplinary Measures has been issued in formal form.\nThe social credit system has been tied to larger policy objectives as well. For example, the General Office\nof the State Council and the General Office of the CCP issued a joint opinion on promoting a high-quality\ncredit system in order to further China\u2019s \u201cdual circulation\u201d objectives. In addition, in November 2022, the\nMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST) announced a new pilot project for evaluating science,\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics talent. Under MOST\u2019s new pilot project, evaluation of\nscientists\u2019 performance is to incorporate metrics related to their moral character, which includes their social", "credit record, in order to ensure that scientific researchers have no history of plagiarism or academic fraud.\nThis pilot project appears to reflect China\u2019s struggle to improve the quality of its scientific research talent.\nForeign companies also have numerous concerns with China\u2019s social credit system, which is becoming\nincreasingly complex and expansive. They are concerned that the Chinese Government will use it to\ndisadvantage or coerce foreign companies or provide favorable treatment to domestic companies. They are\nconcerned that the Chinese Government will use the social credit system to pressure them to act in\nfurtherance of China\u2019s industrial policies or other state priorities or otherwise to make investments or\nconduct their business operations in ways that run counter to market principles or their own business\nstrategies. In addition, foreign companies are concerned about the opaque nature of the social credit system.", "Currently, for example, a company sometimes only learns about its negative ratings when, for example, it\nrequests a permit and receives a denial, even though the Measures for Administration of the List of Serious\nViolators of Trust and Law includes a requirement that companies be informed of their being censured in\nadvance. Other times, a company learns for the first time that it has been censured when a Chinese\nGovernment agency posts its name on the agency\u2019s website, even though the censuring of a company can\ncause severe harm to the company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its efforts to attract customers, secure\nneeded financing or make new investments. When Chinese Government agencies begin to pursue joint\npunishment in the way that NDRC envisions, it will mean that an infraction in one regulatory context could\nhave wider consequences across the company\u2019s entire business operations.", "have wider consequences across the company\u2019s entire business operations.\nForeign companies are also concerned about the links between corporate social credit and individual social\ncredit. They can foresee the Chinese Government using the social credit system as another tool to coerce\nforeign companies and those who work for them not to cross political redlines on sensitive matters like\ndeprivation of human rights. Foreign companies can also foresee the Chinese Government potentially using\ncorporate social credit in the future to exert extraterritorial influence by threatening the social credit\nstanding of foreign companies or their officials for behavior or speech outside of China. Similarly, foreign\ncompanies are concerned that China will abuse its legion of laws regulating how data is stored and\ntransferred to access information to use against them.\nAdministrative Licensing\nU.S. companies continue to encounter significant problems with a variety of administrative licensing", "processes in China, including processes to secure product approvals, investment approvals, business\nexpansion approvals, business license renewals, and even approvals for routine business activities. While\nthere has been an overall reduction in license approval requirements and a focus on decentralizing licensing\napproval processes, U.S. companies continue to report that one of their key concerns involves China\u2019s\nproblematic licensing approval processes. Among other things, according to U.S. companies, China\nprovides preferential treatment to Chinese companies, including both state-owned and private enterprises,\nwhen granting license approvals.\nIn July 2024, the Central Committee of the CCP and the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on\nPromoting the Growth and Development of the Private Economy, sometimes referred to as the \u201c31-Point\n92 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nPlan.\u201d The measure, whose stated objective is to promote the growth and development of the private sector", "in China, purports to prohibit government agencies from using administrative requirements, such as filing,\nlicensing, and approvals, to create market entry barriers. In theory, foreign companies, as part of the\nChinese private economy, should benefit from the measure. However, the measure has not resulted in any\nconcrete improvements for U.S. companies seeking to conduct business in China.\nTransparency\nOne of the core principles reflected throughout China\u2019s WTO accession agreement is the enhancement of\ntransparency. Unfortunately, after more than 20 years of WTO membership, China still has a poor record\nwhen it comes to adherence to its transparency obligations.\nPublication of Trade-Related Measures\nIn its WTO accession agreement, China committed to adopt a single official journal for the publication of\nall trade-related laws, regulations, and other measures. In 2006, China adopted such a single official", "journal, administered by MOFCOM. However, many trade-related measures are never published in this\njournal.\nAt the central government level, it appears that China only publishes trade-related measures issued by some,\nbut not all, central-government entities in the official journal, as China tends to take a narrow view regarding\nthe types of trade-related measures that are required to be published in the official journal. For those\ngovernment entities whose trade-related measures are published in the official journal, China more\ncommonly (but still not regularly) publishes trade-related administrative regulations and departmental rules\nin the journal, but it is rare for China to publish other measures such as opinions, circulars, orders, directives,\nand notices, which are known as \u201cnormative documents\u201d in China\u2019s legal system. Normative documents\nare regulatory documents that do not fall into the category of administrative regulations or departmental", "rules, but still impose binding obligations on enterprises and individuals. Although the State Council\nintroduced a definition for \u201cadministrative normative documents\u201d in 2014, this definition is narrow and\ndoes not appear to encompass all normative documents, nor has it resulted in their regular publication as\nrequired by China\u2019s WTO commitments. Among other things, publication of all normative documents\nwould facilitate compliance by enterprises and individuals with the obligations addressed in them.\nMeanwhile, the situation is even worse for measures issued by sub-central governments in China. China\nrarely publishes any trade-related measures issued by sub-central governments in the official journal.\nFinally, China rarely publishes certain types of trade-related measures from either the central level or the\nsub-central level of government in the official journal. As discussed above in the Industrial Subsidies\nsection, an important example involves subsidy measures.", "section, an important example involves subsidy measures.\nNotice-and-Comment Procedures\nIn its WTO accession agreement, China committed to provide a reasonable time period for public notice\nand comment before implementing new trade-related laws, regulations, and other measures. While little\nprogress has been made in implementing this commitment at the sub-central government level, the National\nPeople\u2019s Congress instituted notice-and-comment procedures for draft laws in 2008, and shortly thereafter\nChina indicated that it would also publish proposed trade- and economic-related administrative regulations\nand departmental rules for public comment. Subsequently, the National People\u2019s Congress began regularly\npublishing draft laws for public comment.

China has also yet to formalize its use of notice-and-comment procedures for proposed\nnormative documents, although some individual ministries have standardized their internal procedures for\nissuing administrative normative documents. In addition, even when China provides for a notice-and-\ncomment period, too often it issues the final measure immediately after the end of the comment period,\nsuggesting that it did not give serious consideration to the comments received.

Prior to 2014, China had only compiled translations of trade-related\nlaws and administrative regulations (into English), but not other types of measures, such as departmental\nrules, normative documents, and sub-central government measures. Even for trade-related laws and\nadministrative regulations, China was years behind in publishing these translations. At the July 2014 S&ED", "meeting, China committed that it would extend its translation efforts to include not only trade-related laws\nand administrative regulations but also trade-related departmental rules. Subsequently, in March 2015,\nChina issued a measure requiring trade-related departmental rules to be translated into English. This\nmeasure also provides that the translation of a departmental rule normally must be published before\nimplementation.\nNotably, however, even if China were to fully implement its existing measures requiring translations, they\nwould not be sufficient to bring China into full WTO compliance in this area. China does not consistently\npublish translations of trade-related laws, administrative regulations, and departmental rules in a timely\nmanner (i.e., before implementation), nor does it publish any translations of trade-related normative\ndocuments or trade-related measures issued by sub-central governments.\nEnquiry Point", "documents or trade-related measures issued by sub-central governments.\nEnquiry Point\nIn its WTO accession agreement, China committed to establish an enquiry point that would respond to\nrequests for information relating to legal measures required to be published in its official journal.

Despite the\nobligation in its WTO accession agreement to either provide the documents or respond in writing within 45\ndays, China did not meet this deadline.

Egypt has bound 99.4 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nwith an average WTO bound tariff rate of 36.9 percent.\nOn June 9, 2022, Egypt lowered tariffs under Decree No. 218/2022 on over 150 categories of imported\nproducts, including pharmaceuticals and natural gas-powered automobiles, with most reductions aimed at\ncapital goods and inputs for agriculture and industry. These lowered tariff levels remained in place in 2024.\nTariffs on agricultural equipment, fertilizer, and seeds have dropped from 5 percent to 2 percent. Tariffs\non industrial vehicles, such as aircraft, tractors, railcars, and ships, have fallen from 40 percent to 2 percent,\nand the duty on natural gas-powered automobiles has fallen from 30 percent to 2 percent. In 2023, under\nDecree No. 67/2023, Egypt reduced tariffs on imported components for local mobile phone production", "Decree No. 67/2023, Egypt reduced tariffs on imported components for local mobile phone production\nincluding peripherals such as headphones, batteries, and cameras, which had ranged from 5 percent to 30\npercent, down to 2 percent.\nEgypt\u2019s tariff on passenger cars with engines of 1600 cubic centimeters (cc) or less is 40 percent, and its\ntariff on cars with engines of greater than 1600 cc is 135 percent. Tariffs on a number of processed and\nhigh-value food products, including poultry, meat, apples, pears, cherries, and almonds, range from 20\npercent to 30 percent. Alcoholic beverages for use in the tourism sector have a 300 percent tariff plus a 40\npercent sales tax. The tariffs on alcoholic beverages for use outside the tourism sector range from 1,200\npercent on beer and 1,800 percent on wine to 3,000 percent on sparkling wine and spirits.\nOn June 3, 2023, the Egyptian Ministry of Finance issued a statement indicating that importers are required", "to make an advance payment of 1 percent of the estimated taxes and fees due on imported goods, instead\nof the 30 percent payment previously required. Importers will pay the balance in addition to the customs\ntariffs when the goods arrive in Egypt.\nIn November 2021, Egypt increased tariffs under Decree 558/2021 for a number of products, including\nmobile phones. To date, Egypt continues to impose a 10 percent duty on mobile phones. U.S. stakeholders\nhave asserted that Egypt\u2019s tariffs on mobile phones appear to be in excess of its WTO bound rates.\n116 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nImport Restrictions\nIn July 2006, Egypt issued Ministerial Decree No. 766/2006, lifting the ban on imports of frozen whole\nbirds from all origins. The decree does not reference the import of poultry parts and offal as being\npermissible, which acts as a de facto ban on U.S. chicken limb and offal exports to Egypt. In 2022, Egypt", "began allowing shipments of chicken leg quarters from the United States on a limited basis. The United\nStates pushed to expand access for poultry at the October 2024 TIFA meeting in Washington and continues\nto make this request.\nImport Licensing\nThe National Food Safety Authority (NFSA) must register and approve all nutritional supplements,\nspecialty foods, and dietary foods according to NFSA Decision No. 1/2018 on the Rules Governing the\nRegistration and Handling of Foods for Special Dietary Uses. Importers must apply for a license to import\nspecialty food products and renew the license every five years. License renewals can cost up to $1,000 per\nrenewal, depending on the product. In December 2021, the NFSA issued Decree No. 11/2021, which more\nthan doubled the cost of conducting an inspection of imported food.\nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation\nEgypt\u2019s Customs Authority continues to employ reference pricing when assessing duties. Egypt\u2019s Customs", "Valuation Committee often engages in lengthy deliberations without coming to a final decision on customs\nvaluation appeals filed by U.S. businesses. Egyptian Ministerial Decree No. 86/2023 established a\ncommittee to plan for and implement an advance ruling system, following significant engagement by the\nU.S. Government through the TIFA dialogue and in other bilateral and multilateral fora. The U.S.\nGovernment is working closely with Egypt\u2019s Customs Authority on the implementation of an advance\nruling system, including on the draft regulation.\nEgyptian Ministerial Decrees No. 283/2023 and No. 284/2023 implemented a new integrated risk\nmanagement system for inspecting imported non-food industrial goods.

In 2012, Egypt became a\nContracting Party to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) 1958 Agreement. As\nof June 2014, Egypt has applied European Union regional emissions and UNECE safety standards for\nvehicles and automotive parts, thereby blocking imports of U.S. vehicles that meet comparable U.S.\nregulatory emissions and safety standards. Egyptian law also prohibits the importation of used vehicles for\ncommercial purposes, pursuant to Ministerial Decree No. 580/1998 and Annex 2 to Ministerial Decree No.\n770/2005.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 117\nAs noted above, Egypt does not recognize U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), even\nthough U.S. standards achieve comparable regulatory goals. As a result, exports of these goods to Egypt", "have declined significantly since 2015. The United States has raised this issue in TIFA Council meetings,\nincluding the October 2024 TIFA dialogue. As part of the U.S. effort to persuade Egypt to accept vehicles\nconforming with FMVSS, the United States conducted a regulatory assessment in June 2022 of automotive\nsafety standards. Furthermore, the United States and Egypt held technical consultations and discussions in\nMay 2023 and February 2024 to assist Egypt in understanding FMVSS and the U.S. automotive safety\nregulatory system so as to allay Egyptian concerns. U.S. and Egyptian stakeholders continue to work\ntogether to agree on a mutually satisfactory approach for Egypt to accept FMVSS.\nHalal Import Requirements\nIn August 2021, the Government of Egypt announced that it would extend the scope of its halal certification\nrequirements to include dairy and other agricultural products in addition to the existing requirement for", "imports of poultry and meat products. It also announced that IS EG Halal, a private U.S. company, would\nbe the sole certifying body approved to certify exports to Egypt as halal. In December 2021, Egypt notified\nthis measure to the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Committee) with an\nimplementation date of January 29, 2022. However, following U.S. and other WTO Members\u2019 requests,\nEgypt postponed implementation multiple times, most recently until January 1, 2026. The lack of\ntransparency and the uncertainty created by these new requirements has contributed to a drop in U.S. dairy\nexports to Egypt. In 2022, the volume of U.S. dairy exports dropped 54 percent to 15 million tons. In\n2023, it dropped another 12 percent and a further 20 percent in 2024.\nIn 2024, Egypt published Decision No. 1 of 2023 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reform, General\nOrganization for Veterinary Services, which establishes eligibility requirements for accredited halal", "certification bodies authorized by the Government of Egypt. As written, the eligibility requirements\nspecified would exclude all U.S. halal certification bodies. In 2024, the Government of Egypt sent a Note\nVerbale to the U.S. Embassy informing the United States that Halal Markets, LLC would act as a service\nprovider company for IS EG Halal Egypt. However, there has been a lack of information about this entity\nand the specific role it will have in the halal certification and export of relevant U.S. products to Egypt,\ndespite numerous requests by the United States for clarification. The United States has engaged in bilateral\nand multilateral fora with Egypt to request that Egypt bring certainty, predictability, and fairness to its halal\npolicy implementation efforts by publishing an implementing regulation and notifying all relevant\nmeasures. To ensure uniform implementation, Egypt should provide clarification concerning fee structures,", "documentation requirements, and production process requirements. Additionally, the United States has\nrequested that Egypt allow U.S. and other halal certification bodies to continue certifying product destined\nfor Egypt, and to suspend any new requirements until additional transparency and flexibility are in place.\nThe sole certification body and lack of certainty on program details appear to have impaired U.S. producers\u2019\nability to export to the country, raising concerns under the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.\nThe United States continues to assess the situation and actively engage with Egypt regarding these matters,\nincluding through the TIFA dialogue and in other bilateral and multilateral fora.\nSanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers\nSeed Potatoes\nThe United States remains unable to export seed potatoes to Egypt because the Egyptian Ministry of\nAgriculture Central Administration for Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) has not reached consensus with the U.S.", "Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) on pest risk mitigation\n118 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nmeasures.

Egypt has made some efforts to\nstrengthen intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, including by passing Law No. 163/2023\nin August 2023 to establish the Egyptian Agency for Intellectual Property. Egypt also adopted a new\nnational IP strategy and a system to facilitate information sharing among customs offices on potential\ncounterfeiting and published patent examination guidelines for biotechnology. Despite these\nimprovements, concerns remain. Egypt continues to lack deterrent-level penalties for IP violations and ex", "officio authority for customs officials to seize counterfeit and pirated goods at the border.

El\nSalvador eliminated its tariffs on rice, yellow corn, and chicken leg quarters in January 2023, and eliminated\ntariffs on dairy products on January 1, 2025. El Salvador is required under the CAFTA\u2013DR to make Tariff\nrate quota (TRQs) available on January 1 of each year.

The lowest rate applies only to aguardiente, a locally bottled spirit made from\ncane sugar. Whiskey, which is exclusively imported, is assessed at the highest rate. Distinctions between\ntypes of distilled spirits result in lower tax rates on domestically produced spirits compared to imported\nproducts.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation\nU.S. companies have expressed concerns regarding the inconsistent and discretionary application of\ncustoms regulations and procedures, resulting in unpredictable delays and administrative fines. For\nexample, exporting from a duty-free zone is unduly cumbersome, with a requirement that representatives", "of the receiving company and the shipping company be physically present for the exchange of documents\nand release of materials.

To register product samples,\nthe Sanitary Regulation Superintendency (SRS) requires large quantities of the product for testing,\nincluding samples of each available flavor of the same product. In addition, SRS only accepts laboratory\nresults from the Ministry of Health\u2019s lab, thus delaying the product registration process. USDA continues\nto discuss with Salvadoran Government officials a proposal to accept U.S. laboratory results for registration\npurposes.\nThe Salvadoran Government requires that grain shipments be fumigated at importers\u2019 expense unless they\nare accompanied by a certificate stating that the grain is free of weed seeds and free from kernel smut", "pathogen (Tilletia barclayana).

The proclamation further requires foreign banks to include Ethiopian citizens on their boards and\nreportedly limits foreigners to one seat on the boards of Ethiopian banks.\nFew international banks maintain representative offices, and all trade financing is required by law to go", "through an Ethiopian bank. This creates significant challenges for foreign investors with accounts outside\nEthiopia. On December 24, 2022, Ethiopia\u2019s Parliament approved the opening of digital financial services\nto foreign companies to expand financial services in geographic areas underserved by traditional banks,\nincrease competition in the telecommunications industry, and to facilitate the exchange of technology and\nknowledge. In September 2023, for the first time, the National Bank of Ethiopia allowed some foreign\ndirect investors to open accounts outside Ethiopia to service external debts, pay for foreign insurance and\nwarranty claims, meet financial obligations to foreign contractors, and cover other foreign capital and\noperational expenses.\n126 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nIn November 2023, a U.S.-backed leasing company, which was the only foreign-owned financial services\ncompany operating in Ethiopia, closed in response to a multi-year dispute with the Government of Ethiopia", "over its prohibitions of U.S. dollar-dominated lease agreements.\nThe Council of Ministers approved a bill in June 2024 that would allow foreign banks to open local\nsubsidiaries, branches, or representative offices. Foreign banks would also be allowed to acquire shares in\nexisting banks, although foreign ownership and foreign-owned Ethiopian organizations are limited to no\nmore than 40 percent of total shares. The bill was passed by parliament on December 17, 2024.\nINVESTMENT BARRIERS\nMany formal and informal barriers impede foreign investment in Ethiopia. The 2020 Investment Law\nallows foreign investors to invest in any area except those that are clearly reserved for domestic investors.\nThe law reserves banking, insurance, microfinance, electricity transmission and distribution, and retail and\nwholesale trade for domestic investors. Foreign investors can jointly invest as minority stakeholders with", "domestic investors in areas such as freight forwarding and shipping, domestic air transportation services,\ncross-country public transport services, advertisement and promotion, and accounting and auditing services.\nFor joint ventures with state-owned enterprises (SOEs), some investors report that the government\ninformally encourages foreign investors to hire local labor and utilize domestic raw materials.\nSTATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES\nAlthough the Government of Ethiopia has launched processes to fully or partially privatize some SOEs,\nmost notably under the Homegrown Economic Reform Plan, SOEs continue to dominate major sectors of\nthe economy. These include the telecommunications, power, banking, insurance, air transport, certain\nagricultural processing, industrial parks, and shipping industries. Many SOEs maintain a monopoly over\ntheir respective sectors, which allows the Government of Ethiopia to dictate prevailing rates for many goods", "and services. U.S. investors complain of the lack of a level playing field when it comes to SOEs. In 2019,\nthe Government of Ethiopia passed a law that prohibits certain SOEs from accessing new loans and instructs\nthem to focus on completing outstanding projects. SOEs, however, have considerable advantages over\nprivate firms, such as expedited customs clearance processing, priority access to financing and foreign\ncurrency from the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, preferences in government tenders and land acquisition,\nand marketing assistance. In December 2021, the Government of Ethiopia established Ethiopian\nInvestment Holdings, a sovereign wealth fund, to prepare over 40 SOEs for full or partial privatization.\nThe Government of Ethiopia has offered to sell eight state-owned sugar enterprises and a 45 percent stake\nin Ethio Telecom to foreign bidders. Thus far, Ethiopia has failed to attract interest in the Ethio Telecom", "stake, closing auctions with no successful bidders in 2021, 2022, or 2023.\nTransport and logistics are predominantly conducted by SOEs in Ethiopia, and monopolistic market\nconditions in multimodal transport operations and inadequate infrastructure inhibit private sector logistics\ncompanies. Consequently, logistics costs comprise approximately 22 percent to 27 percent of final costs\nfor many products and shipping and freight costs are approximately 60 percent higher than in neighboring\ncountries. Under the framework of a comprehensive logistics strategy, the Government of Ethiopia has\nslated the logistics sector for liberalization, and Ethiopian Railways officials report the border crossing\nprocess between Ethiopia and Djibouti by train has been streamlined. On October 13, 2024, the Minister\nof Transport and Logistics proposed a policy allowing foreign investors to own 100 percent of logistics", "companies, an increase from the previous cap of 49 percent. The policy must be approved by the Council\nof Ministers.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 127\nOTHER BARRIERS\nBribery and Corruption\nEthiopian and foreign businesses routinely encounter corruption in tax collection, customs clearance, and\nland administration. Some U.S. businesses operating in Ethiopia reported that they were frequently\nsolicited for bribes to secure business contracts. Tax administration in Ethiopia is corrupt and inefficient,\nand the Ethiopian Government supplements revenues by levying higher taxes on foreign investors and\nbusinesses and limiting their ability to appeal tax levies. U.S. and other foreign companies complain they\nare unfairly targeted for tax collection compared with local companies and are presented with spurious tax\nbills. In November 2022, the Government of Ethiopia recognized corruption as a threat to national security", "and an obstacle to doing business and formed a new National Anti-Corruption Committee led by the head\nof the National Intelligence and Security Service. Between June 2023 and June 2024, the Ministry of Justice\nAnti-Corruption Directorate prosecuted 186 cases, resulting in 164 convictions.\nCommercial Code Enforcement\nIn 2021, Ethiopia reformed its Commercial Code for the first time in 62 years, aiming to bring its\ncommercial law in line with international best practices and address business community concerns.\nImplementation of the new code across ministries is ongoing, which is expected to lessen the difficulty of\ndoing business in Ethiopia by facilitating trade license registration and renewal, providing registration\nexemptions for some companies, and allowing new and different types of businesses to form and operate\nin Ethiopia. Some members of the business community have expressed concern about inconsistent\nenforcement of the new code.\nForeign Currency Controls", "enforcement of the new code.\nForeign Currency Controls\nForeign exchange shortages have been a significant barrier to business transactions, including trade\ntransactions and remitting profits and dividends. In July 2024, Ethiopia shifted to a market-determined\nforeign exchange regime, moving from a fixed exchange rate to a floating exchange rate. The Government\nof Ethiopia expects the new foreign market to ease businesses\u2019 access to foreign exchange. However, there\nare reports of foreign exchange shortages in the early stages of this market\u2019s development. As a result,\nthere has been difficulty in obtaining foreign currency, hampering manufacturers\u2019 ability to import goods\nand repatriate profits, despite laws allowing investors to remit profits and dividends. Difficulty obtaining\nforeign currency for inputs and repatriating profits has been cited by U.S. companies as a major impediment\nto foreign investment.", "to foreign investment.\nThe National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) issued a Foreign Exchange Directive to a commercial bank in July\n2024. All imports, exports, and outgoing foreign payments require a foreign exchange permit, which are\nto be provided by commercial banks. In July 2024, the NBE permitted exporters to retain 50 percent of\ntheir earnings in foreign currency while requiring the remaining 50 percent to be exchanged at a commercial\nbank in the equivalent amount of the national currency, Ethiopian birr. In November, 2024, the Ethiopian\nGovernment updated the guidance to permit exporters to retain 50 percent of the foreign currency they\ngenerate in their Ethiopian accounts for an independent period, while continuing to require them to\nsurrender the remaining 50 percent to commercial banks. Additionally, in August 2024, Ethiopia allowed\ntraders to import goods using the franco valuta, traders use their own foreign currency to pay import costs", "rather than purchasing foreign exchange from a bank. The NBE allowed traders under the franco valuta\nscheme to import all goods except fuel-powered vehicles, weapons, and security equipment. Ethiopia\npreviously only allowed this mechanism for importing basic commodities such as edible oil, wheat flour,\nrice, and infant formula.\n128 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nEUROPEAN UNION\nOVERVIEW\nThe United States and the Member States of the European Union (EU) share the largest economic\nrelationship in the world. Trade and investment flows between the United States and the EU are a key pillar\nof prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic and generate substantial economic opportunities.\nGoods and services produced by the United States nonetheless face persistent barriers entering and\nmaintaining access to certain sectors of the EU market, which limits the opportunity of U.S. workers and\nbusinesses to benefit from transatlantic trade. This chapter of the National Trade Estimate (NTE) Report", "highlights the most significant of these barriers, some of which have persisted despite repeated efforts at\nresolution through bilateral consultations, World Trade Organization (WTO) committee meetings, or WTO\ndispute settlement. Certain barriers have been highlighted in the annual NTE Report for many years.\nIMPORT POLICIES\nTariffs\nThe EU\u2019s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 5.0 percent in 2023 (latest data\navailable). The EU\u2019s average MFN applied tariff rate was 10.8 percent for agricultural products and 4.1\npercent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). The EU has bound 100 percent of its\ntariff lines in the WTO, with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 5.0 percent.\nAlthough the EU\u2019s tariffs are generally low for non-agricultural goods, some EU tariffs are high, such as\nrates of up to 26 percent for fish and seafood, 22 percent for trucks, 14 percent for bicycles, 10 percent for", "passenger vehicles, and 6.5 percent for fertilizers and plastics.\nMeursing Table Tariff Codes\nMany processed food products, such as confectionary products, baked goods, and miscellaneous food\npreparations, are subject to a special tariff code system in the EU. Under this system, often referred to as\nthe \u201cMeursing\u201d table, the EU charges a tariff on each imported product based on the product\u2019s content of\nmilk protein, milk fat, starch, and sugar. As a result, products that the United States and other countries\nmight consider equivalent for tariff classification purposes sometimes receive different rates of duty in the\nEU depending on the particular composition of each product. The difficulty of calculating Meursing duties\nimposes an unnecessary administrative burden on, and creates uncertainty for exporters, especially those\nseeking to ship new products to the EU.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nImport Licensing \u2013 Bananas", "seeking to ship new products to the EU.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nImport Licensing \u2013 Bananas\nFollowing years of disputes, beginning under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1947 (GATT\n1947) and later under the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding, the United States and other countries in\n2010 reached agreements with the EU to resolve complaints about successive EU banana import regimes.\nBeginning in 2013, a U.S. stakeholder expressed concerns to the U.S. Government about actions taken since\n2010 by Italian customs authorities to collect retroactive payment of customs duties due to the authorities\u2019\nunilateral re-interpretation of the validity of certain EU banana import licenses under pre-2006 EU\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 129\nregulations. In 2017, the Italian Supreme Court, on jurisdictional grounds, ruled against the Italian\nGovernment and ordered authorities to repay the collected duties to the U.S. stakeholder. While the duties", "had been repaid to the stakeholder by December 31, 2024, Italian customs authorities continue to re-issue\nsome of the previous retroactive duty assessments against the stakeholder.\nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation\nNotwithstanding the existence of customs legislation that governs all Member States, the EU does not\nadminister its laws through a single customs administration. Rather, there are separate agencies responsible\nfor the administration of EU customs law in each Member State. It is thus difficult for the EU to ensure\nthat its rules and decisions on classification, valuation, origin, and customs procedures are applied\nuniformly throughout the Member States, and U.S. exports suffer from the uneven and inconsistent\napplication of these requirements.\nThe Binding Tariff Information program provided for by EU-level law, but administered at the Member\nState level, does provide for advance rulings on tariff classification and country of origin. However, EU", "rules do not require the customs agency in one Member State to follow the decisions of the customs agency\nin another Member State with respect to materially identical issues. In some cases where the customs\nagency of a Member State administers EU law differently from, or disagrees with, the Binding Tariff\nInformation issued by another Member State, the matter may be referred to the Customs Code Committee\n(CCC). The CCC consists of Member State representatives and is chaired by a European Commission\nrepresentative. Although a stated goal for the CCC is to help reconcile differences among Member States\nand thereby help to achieve uniformity of administration, in practice its success in this regard has been\nlimited. The CCC and other EU-level institutions do not provide transparency in decision-making or\nopportunities for participation by traders, which might make them more effective tools for achieving the\nuniform administration and application of EU customs law.", "uniform administration and application of EU customs law.\nIn addition, the EU lacks tribunals or procedures for the prompt review and EU-wide correction of\nadministrative actions relating to customs matters. Instead, review is provided in the tribunals of each\nMember State, and the rules regarding these reviews vary from Member State to Member State. A trader\nencountering differing treatment in multiple Member States must bring a separate appeal in each Member\nState whose agency rendered an adverse decision.\nUltimately, a question of interpretation of EU law may be referred to the Court of Justice of the European\nUnion (CJEU). Although the judgments of the CJEU apply throughout the EU, referral of a question to the\nCJEU is generally discretionary, may take many years, and may not afford sufficient redress. Thus,\nobtaining corrections with EU-wide effect for administrative actions relating to customs matters is", "obtaining corrections with EU-wide effect for administrative actions relating to customs matters is\nfrequently cumbersome and time-consuming. The United States has raised concerns regarding the lack of\nuniform administration of EU customs law with the EU in various forums, including in the WTO Dispute\nSettlement Body (DSB).\nThe European Commission has sought to modernize and simplify customs rules and processes. The Union\nCustoms Code (UCC), adopted by the European Commission in 2013, entered into force in 2016. While\nthe UCC contains a number of procedural changes, the key element of a harmonized information technology\ninfrastructure has yet to be completed. Member States continue to use different data templates.

The United States regularly raises concerns, both in bilateral\nengagement and in the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (WTO TBT Committee), that EU", "engagement and in the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (WTO TBT Committee), that EU\nnotifications often take place at a stage in the EU\u2019s regulatory process when it is too late to revise the\nmeasure to take into consideration any substantive concerns raised by other WTO Members. Furthermore,\nnotifications of proposed measures often lack specificity, or incorporate by reference the publication of\nfuture, European-unique standards that do not yet exist, so that non-European producers do not have a\nmeaningful opportunity to engage or offer informed comments.\nFor example, under the EU\u2019s regulatory processes for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and\nRestriction of Chemicals (REACH, Regulation (EC) 1907/2006) and Classification, Labeling, and\nPackaging (CLP, Regulation (EC) 1272/2008), proposed restrictions are typically notified to the WTO only\nafter scientific review and regulatory impact committees have convened and the European Commission\u2019s", "domestic consultations have concluded. These domestic consultations are not always transparent to non-\nEU stakeholders, which can limit their ability to provide comment and for those comments to be taken into\nconsideration. In other cases, measures undergo significant changes during the negotiations among the\nCouncil of the European Union (European Council), European Commission, and European Parliament,\nabsent additional consultations with stakeholders, notifications, or impact assessments. Finally, failure to\nnotify measures with adequate comment periods is also observed at the Member State level, including in\nthe case of recent Irish alcohol labeling regulations. Improvement and greater consistency in EU and\nMember State notification of measures could benefit U.S. exports by contributing to a more predictable\nmarket environment.\nEuropean Standardization and Conformity Assessment Procedures", "market environment.\nEuropean Standardization and Conformity Assessment Procedures\nThe EU\u2019s exclusionary approach to standards-related measures, including its conformity assessment\nframework, and its efforts to encourage governments around the world to adopt its restrictive approach,\nimposes significant burdens on U.S. workers and exporters. In particular, the EU\u2019s approach impedes\nmarket access for products that do not conform to European regional standards (ENs), including products\nthat comply with international standards that are not harmonized with ENs, even though these international\nstandards may meet or exceed the EU regulatory requirements. Products regulated by the EU must conform\nto these EU-specific regional standards in order to benefit from a \u201cpresumption of conformity\u201d with the\nEU\u2019s essential regulatory requirements. U.S. workers and exporters thus face additional burdens in", "EU\u2019s essential regulatory requirements. U.S. workers and exporters thus face additional burdens in\naccessing the EU market not faced by domestic producers in the EU and often not faced by EU exporters\nwhen accessing the U.S. market.\nENs can only be developed through three European Standards Organizations (ESOs), as directed by the\nEuropean Commission through a standardization request. The three ESOs are the European Committee for\nStandardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), and\nthe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Within these designated ESOs, the CEN\nand CENELEC technical committees draft harmonized ENs. Both generally exclude non-EU nationals\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 131\nfrom participating in their standard-drafting process. In the limited instances where non-EU nationals do\nparticipate, they are not allowed to vote.", "participate, they are not allowed to vote.\nOn February 2, 2022, the EU published the European Standardization Strategy, which, inter alia, amends\nRegulation (EU) 1025/2012 on European Standardization Organizations to require that the ESOs restrict\nthe involvement of non-EU interests in the development of harmonized EN standards. The change\nprimarily affects the development of standards at the ETSI, which specializes in information and\ncommunications technologies and had been the only ESO to provide for direct participation by foreign\nfirms. In addition, new policies implemented by the European Commission, such as a refusal to reference\nunderlying standards developed outside of Europe and new restrictions imposed on participation in expert\nadvisory groups (including the newly created High Level Forum on European Standardization), suggest a\nsustained effort to exclude foreign participants, undermine the acceptance of international standards", "developed in the United States, and project European regional standards abroad. The United States is\nconcerned that the European Standardization Strategy and other exclusionary steps indicate that the EU is\nmoving further away from cooperation with trading partners in standardization, and barriers in the\ntransatlantic market will thus be exacerbated rather than ameliorated. The United States has relayed its\nconcerns to the EU through the United States\u2013European Union Trade and Technology Council, as well as\nthrough comments in response to an EU public consultation on the functioning of Regulation (EU)\n1025/2012, submitted on July 24, 2024.\nAs part of its free trade agreements, the EU seeks commitments affirming that only a standard issued by a\nsubset of specific standards-developing organizations, none of which are domiciled in the United States, be\nconsidered an \u201cinternational standard\u201d (e.g., the EU\u2013Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, Article 7.6).", "This practice accords preferential treatment to organizations in which the EU carries an outsized influence\n(e.g., the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations within the framework of the United\nNations Economic Commission for Europe) or with which the ESOs have existing cooperation agreements\n(e.g., the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical\nCommission). This approach is narrower than what is provided for under the WTO TBT Agreement and\nrelated decisions of the WTO TBT Committee, which recognize \u201cinternational standards\u201d as those\ndeveloped in accordance with certain principles, and without reference to particular institutions or methods\nof organization.\nThe United States also has serious concerns regarding the EU\u2019s conformity assessment framework, set out\nin Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and Decision 768/2008/EC. Regulation (EC) 765/2008 requires each Member", "in Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and Decision 768/2008/EC.

Further, the EU\u2019s interpretation\nof Decision 768/2008/EC sets out that conformity assessment bodies must be located in the EU in order to\ntest to EU regulations. This geographic restriction denies U.S.-domiciled conformity assessment bodies\nthe opportunity to certify products for the EU market outside of existing mutual recognition agreements. It\nalso raises significant market access concerns for U.S. producers whose products have been tested or\ncertified by conformity assessment bodies located outside the EU. Without any associated improvement in\nquality or safety, the EU conformity assessment approach increases time to market and raises costs for U.S.\nexporters.\nChemical Regulations", "exporters.\nChemical Regulations\nThe EU\u2019s framework for chemicals policy continues to present a number of significant barriers for U.S.\nexporters. Stakeholders have raised concerns that, as part of the registration process under REACH, they\nmust provide data that is not relevant to the specific hazards and proposed uses of a registered substance.\nAmendments to the classification of chemicals under the CLP often appear driven by a process that does\nnot allow adequate time for stakeholder comment, even when the proposed changes differ significantly\n132 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nfrom the globally harmonized classifications followed by U.S. industry and other economies. As with other\nsectors, the United States is also concerned that the EU\u2019s reliance on a \u201cprecautionary\u201d or \u201chazard-based\u201d\napproach to regulation of products can result in severe limitations on the use of products without a basis in", "scientific assessment of the actual risks of exposure in a specific use. Additionally, Member States\u2019\napplication of REACH appears to be inconsistent and lack transparency, which can result in requirements\nthat are more onerous for U.S. exporters than they are for EU businesses and products that are already in\nthe EU market.\nClassification, Labeling, and Packaging Hazard Classes\nThe United States has voiced concerns regarding the European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)\n2023/707 of December 19, 2022 (amending Regulation (EC) 1272/2008) regarding hazard classes and\ncriteria for the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures, noting that the new CLP\nclassification and labeling requirements will diverge from the Globally Harmonized System of\nClassification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). The United States has encouraged the EU not to preempt\na scientific review by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of new", "a scientific review by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of new\nlabeling requirements and to remain harmonized with the GHS. Delegated Regulation 2023/707 entered\ninto force on April 20, 2023. The EU released guidance on these new classification and labeling\nrequirements in November 2024, with the new requirements going into effect in May 2025 for new\nsubstances and November 2026 for substances already on the market.\nPer- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances\nOn February 7, 2023, the European Chemicals Agency published a proposed restriction that would largely\neliminate the production and use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The United States is\nconcerned that the EU proposal does not consider the different impacts on various PFAS chemicals, nor the\nimplications of the ban for several critical uses, such as in the production of some renewable energy", "products, as well as other manufactured goods such as semiconductors and medical devices, for which there\nare, as yet, no feasible alternatives to PFAS. Additionally, the proposal could impact the implementation\nof global treaties to reduce ozone depletion, such as the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, by\nrestricting alternatives to existing substances. The United States continues to raise these concerns\nbilaterally, including at WTO TBT Committee meetings.\nFluorinated Greenhouse Gases\nIn February 2024, the EU adopted an update to the 2014 Fluorinated Greenhouse Gas (F-Gas) Regulation,\n(EU) 2024/573 that will accelerate the phase-out of many technologies that use F-gases. The Regulation\nincluded restrictions on certain uses of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), even though these gases are not\nrestricted via the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The EU\u2019s decision was taken without", "restricted via the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The EU\u2019s decision was taken without\nconsideration of viable technological and commercially available alternatives. The United States further\nexpressed concerns that the restriction of low GWP HFOs under the F-gas Regulation was premature and\npossibly duplicative of the EU\u2019s proposed PFAS restriction via REACH. The United States repeatedly\nraised concerns regarding the EU\u2019s approach both bilaterally and at the WTO TBT Committee, and\ncontinues to monitor implementation of the measure, as it may have significant implications for U.S.\nexporters.\n(Additional concerns with the EU policies in regard to F-Gas are discussed in the Other Barriers section\nof this NTE Report chapter.)\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 133\nPackaging and Packing Waste Regulation\nOn January 22, 2025, the EU published Regulation (EU) 2025/40 on packaging and packaging waste to", "On January 22, 2025, the EU published Regulation (EU) 2025/40 on packaging and packaging waste to\nreplace an existing directive and regulation in an effort to harmonize Member State packaging and\npackaging waste regulations.

U.S. agricultural and commodity stakeholders have\nraised concerns that due diligence and traceability requirements in the regulation may not be possible for\nU.S. companies to meet. To date, the EU has refused to notify the regulation to WTO Members or to\nprovide an opportunity for WTO Members and other stakeholders to comment on the regulation.

The United States has also been seeking to collaborate with the EU to achieve greater\nalignment on the recognition of eco-label schemes and measures to combat greenwashing.\n(Sanitary and phytosanitary concerns with the European Green Deal are discussed in the Sanitary and\nPhytosanitary Barriers section of this NTE Report chapter.)\nRenewable Energy Directive\nThe EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) ((EC) 2009/28) requires that biofuels and biofuel feedstocks\nobtain a \u201cProof of Sustainability\u201d certification to qualify for tax incentives and national use targets. RED\nalso establishes a methodology and accounting system by which Member States may record and calculate\nrequired greenhouse gas emission savings as compared to a baseline for fossil fuels.\nIn 2018, the European Commission adopted a new Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) for the period", "In 2018, the European Commission adopted a new Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) for the period\n2021 to 2030. RED II entered into force on January 1, 2021 and introduced sustainability requirements for\nforestry biomass (wood pellets). The European Commission began revisions of RED II in 2022, and the\nfinal revisions were published on October 31, 2023. The revisions to RED II increased the EU\u2019s binding\nrenewable target for 2030 to a minimum of 42.5 percent, up from the prior 32 percent target. However, the\nsustainability criteria for biofuels and biomass were not fundamentally changed, which may limit U.S.\nexports of biofuels and biomass that would otherwise provide viable renewable sources for the EU\u2019s\nrenewable energy targets. The United States exported approximately $272 million in wood pellets and\n$440 million in bioethanol to the EU in 2024.\nPesticide Maximum Residue Limits for Environmental Objectives", "Pesticide Maximum Residue Limits for Environmental Objectives\nOn February 15, 2023, the EU published Commission Regulation (EU) 2023/334 to reduce maximum\nresidue limits (MRLs) for clothianidin and thiamethoxam to the limit of determination, in an effort to protect\npollinators, particularly bees, in countries outside of the EU. The measure would effectively bar all imports\nof products to the EU that contain any detectable residue of the two widely used pesticides after March 7,\n2026.\nThe United States shares the EU\u2019s concerns about pollinator health and is actively working to protect bees\nand other pollinators in the United States. However, the global scientific and regulatory community has\nfound that complex interactions among multiple factors affect pollinator health, including the health of\nbees, and that the safe use of the two pesticides may be determined based on local, national, or regional", "contexts by the appropriate competent authorities. The United States has also raised concerns with the EU\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 135\nthat the use of MRLs as an environmental safety management tool could undermine the development and\nuse of international standards for food safety. Given the critical importance of the pesticides identified in\nthe regulation, the measure appears to pose a significant obstacle to international trade and production of\nagricultural products. The European Commission intends to consider additional substances under a similar\napproach. In 2022, 2023, and 2024, the United States raised this issue with the EU at the WTO TBT\nCommittee, WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (WTO SPS Committee), and WTO\nCouncil for Trade in Goods. The United States continues to encourage the EU to pursue a collaborative\napproach to protect pollinators worldwide.\n(Other MRL concerns with the European Union are discussed in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers", "section of this NTE Report chapter.)\nMedical Devices and In-Vitro Diagnostics Regulation\nThe United States continues to be concerned about the implementation of the Medical Device Regulation\n(MDR) and the In-Vitro Medical Device Regulation (IVDR), especially the shortage of notified bodies\navailable to assess medical devices and in-vitro medical devices. The ongoing lack of capacity to conduct\nconformity assessment has led to longer review times, and it remains difficult for some companies,\nespecially small and medium-sized enterprises, to obtain access to reviews. The lengthy review times and\nlack of access impact the ability of companies to keep legacy devices on the EU market and to bring new\ndevices to healthcare providers and patients.\nThe United States has repeatedly engaged the EU through the WTO TBT Committee and bilateral\ndiscussions around those meetings to seek updates on the implementation of the MDR and IVDR, including", "the number of qualified notified bodies to perform conformity assessment requirements. On March 20,\n2023, Regulation (EU) 2023/607 amending the MDR and IVDR took effect, allowing for staggered and\nconditional extension of a transition period to the new rules until 2027 or 2028, according to the risk class\nof the devices.\nOn July 9, 2024, the EU published Regulation (EU) 2024/1860 amending Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and\n(EU) 2017/746 regarding a gradual roll-out of the European database for medical devices called Eudamed,\nwhich includes an extension to the transitional period for certain in-vitro diagnostics and introduces\nnotification obligations for interruptions in supply.\nWine Labeling\nIn May 2023, the EU adopted Regulation (EU) 2021/2117, which introduced a compulsory nutrition\ndeclaration and list of ingredients to be displayed on the label of wine products sold on the EU market\nbeginning December 8, 2023. The regulation permits producers to provide mandatory lists of ingredients", "and nutritional information, excluding allergens and energy content, via an electronic label accessed\nthrough a quick-response (QR) code on the physical label. U.S. industry supports the use of electronic\nlabels to provide additional information for consumers; however, U.S. industry has reported that several\nMember States have different interpretations of EU guidance published in 2023, specifically, on the text\naccompanying the QR code. The United States raised this issue with the EU bilaterally as part of the United\nStates-European Union Wine Dialogue and at the March and June 2024 WTO TBT Committee meetings.\nU.S. industry has raised concerns that differing Member States requirements regarding the word or words\nthat must accompany QR codes may be contrary to the nature of the EU as a single market. In 2024, the\nUnited States exported more than $170 million of wine to the EU.\n136 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nTraditional Terms on Wine", "136 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nTraditional Terms on Wine\nThe EU continues to restrict the use of \u201ctraditional terms,\u201d such as \u201ctawny,\u201d \u201cruby,\u201d and \u201cchateau,\u201d on\nlabels on imported wine. This impedes U.S. wine exports to the EU, including U.S. wines that include\nthese traditional terms as part of their trademarks. U.S. wines sold under a trademark that includes one of\nthe traditional terms can only be marketed in the EU if the trademark was registered before May 2002.\nThe EU has not taken any visible steps to address the concerns of the United States and has consistently\nrefused to provide a timeline for review of the applications for the use of terms submitted by U.S. industry.\nAlcohol Labeling\nIn May 2023, Ireland introduced a Public Health (Alcohol) (Labelling) regulation, which sets unique health\nlabeling requirements for alcohol being sold in the Irish market. The regulation mandates that all alcohol", "beverages display warnings on product packaging informing consumers about the risk of consuming alcohol\nwhen pregnant and the risk of liver disease and fatal cancers from alcohol consumption. U.S. industry has\nraised concerns that unique labeling requirements for the Irish market, which are in addition to the EU-wide\nregulations already adhered to by U.S. industry, would be costly and may disrupt U.S. exports within the\nEU single market. In March 2024, the United States raised procedural concerns about the regulation in the\nWTO TBT Committee meeting and questioned how Ireland\u2019s labeling regime would be reconciled with\nfuture EU-wide requirements on health and warning labeling.\nSanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers\nThe United States remains concerned about a number of measures the EU maintains ostensibly for the\npurposes of food safety and protecting human, animal, or plant life or health. Specifically, the United States", "is concerned that these measures may unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering safety objectives,\nbecause they appear to be applied beyond the extent necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or\nhealth, not based on science, or maintained without sufficient scientific evidence.\nFarm to Fork Strategy\nTo achieve the targets of the European Green Deal, described in the Technical Barriers to Trade section of\nthis Chapter, and the related Farm to Fork (F2F) Strategy introduced in May 2020, the EU has adopted\nmultiple regulations that may inappropriately use food safety standards as the basis for sustainability\nrequirements. Among other things, these targets aim to reduce the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and\nantimicrobials in agricultural production, to achieve the EU\u2019s goal of enhanced food and agricultural\nsustainability by 2030.\nThe EU has also stated it will seek to \u201cobtain ambitious commitments from third countries in key areas,\u201d", "and is increasingly attempting to expand the reach of this policy beyond the EU. Many of the targets were\nconverted into legislative proposals, and the European Parliament and European Council shaped and\namended these proposals as part of the EU legislative process that occurred between 2021 and 2024.\nIt remains to be seen how the EU will implement the broader objectives of the F2F Strategy through these\ninterrelated initiatives, which appear to blend SPS issues with potential TBT requirements like labeling or\ncertification schemes. U.S. stakeholders are concerned that EU implementing regulations may focus on\npromoting EU production practices that are not appropriate, effective, or efficient in other parts of the world\nand, if required, could unnecessarily restrict trade or require farmers in the United States and other countries\noutside the EU to produce crops in less sustainable ways than they otherwise would have, as a precondition\nfor gaining access to the EU market.", "for gaining access to the EU market.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 137\nHormones and Beta-Agonists\nDespite scientific evidence that such meat is safe for consumers, the EU maintains various measures that\nimpose bans and restrictions on meat produced using hormones, beta agonists, and other growth promotants\napproved for use in the United States. U.S. producers cannot export meat or meat products to the EU unless\nthey participate in a costly and burdensome verification program to ensure that hormones, beta agonists, or\nother growth promotants have not been used in their production.\nFor example, the EU continues to ban the use of the beta agonist ractopamine, which promotes leanness\nand enhances feed utilization by animals raised for meat. The EU maintains this ban even though\ninternational standards promulgated by Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) have established\nmaximum residue levels (MRLs) for the safe trade in products produced with ractopamine. The Codex", "maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the safe trade in products produced with ractopamine. The Codex\nMRL was established following a scientific study by the United Nations Food and Agriculture\nOrganization/World Health Organization Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives that found\nractopamine at the specified MRL does not have an adverse impact on human health.\nIn 2019, as part of a compromise solution to the U.S.\u2013EU hormone beef WTO dispute, the United States\nand the EU concluded an agreement that established a duty-free tariff-rate quota (TRQ) for the United\nStates. The agreement went into effect on January 1, 2020, and provided American ranchers an initial TRQ\nof 18,500 metric tons annually, valued at approximately $220 million. The TRQ increases annually over a\nperiod of seven years, and will reach 35,000 metric tons in 2026, valued at approximately $420 million.\nU.S. stakeholders have raised concerns about the requirements of the EU\u2019s residue monitoring program for", "animal products, and U.S. competent authorities continue to work with their counterparts in the EU to\nensure that all requirements are justified based on science and risk and least trade restrictive.\nAntimicrobial Resistance and the Restrictions on the Use of Veterinary Medicinal Products\nIn December 2018, the EU published Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products that seeks\nto address antimicrobial resistance by more strictly defining the criteria for use of antimicrobial products in\nanimal medicine. Regulation (EU) 2019/6 also identifies a list of products that will be exclusively reserved\nfor human medicine and no longer permitted in agricultural production. Article 118 of the regulation\nexpands these restrictions to operators in third countries, who will be required to ensure that animal products\nexported to the EU and intended for human consumption do not originate from animals that have been", "exported to the EU and intended for human consumption do not originate from animals that have been\ntreated with specified antimicrobial medicines reserved for human use or utilized for growth promotion.\nThe official implementation date for Regulation (EU) 2019/6 and related implementing measures is\nSeptember 3, 2026.\nIn February 2024, the EU published Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/399, which amended model\nhealth certificates for entry into the European Union of consignments of certain products of animal origin\nand certain categories of animals. The amended model health certificates will be utilized by exporting\ncountries. On June 28, 2024, the EU notified to the WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary\nMeasures (G/SPS/N/EU/778), which included publication of a list of third countries authorized for the entry\ninto the EU of animals and products of animal origin intended for human consumption. Beginning", "into the EU of animals and products of animal origin intended for human consumption. Beginning\nSeptember 3, 2024, two additional animal health attestations are required to be listed on official health\ncertificates but exporting countries will not be required to make the attestations until the regulation is\nimplemented on September 3, 2026.\nU.S. stakeholders are concerned about the potential impacts of these EU measures, in particular the\nattestation requirements on U.S. exports of animal products to the EU once the measures enter into force.\n138 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nU.S. stakeholders have raised concerns about other provisions that are not based on science or risk and\ninstead promote the adoption of EU practices by third countries rather than recognizing the alternative ways\nthat different competent authorities can arrive at the same level of product safety. U.S. stakeholders are", "also concerned about the EU\u2019s prohibition on the use of non-medically important antimicrobials to promote\ngrowth and increase yield, as this prohibition does not appear to have a scientific justification and specific\nfood safety concerns have not been identified. The United States will continue to engage the EU regarding\nmanagement of antimicrobial resistance and encourage science-based approaches.\nAgricultural Biotechnology\nDecades of data and experience demonstrate the safety of genetically engineered (GE) crops, in addition to\nthe benefits of their use in reducing pesticide use and impact on non-target organisms, while increasing soil\nhealth, crop yields, and farmers\u2019 incomes. Despite these benefits, the lack of predictability, excessive data\nrequirements, and delays in the EU\u2019s approval process for GE crops have prevented products from being\nexported to the EU, even though these products have been approved and grown safely in the United States", "and in other countries for many years.\nThe United States continues to reiterate concerns with delays in the EU\u2019s biotechnology approval\nprocedures under the Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Directive ((EC) 2001/18) and to engage the\nEU in efforts to normalize trade in these products, including through semiannual consultations in\naccordance with the 2008 decision by the United States and the EU to suspend Article 22.6 arbitration\nproceedings associated with the WTO dispute settlement proceeding against the European Communities\n(the EU predecessor entity) regarding the approval of biotechnology products. In 2024, the EU issued five\napprovals and five renewals for GE crops, compared to eight approvals and five renewals in 2023. While\nthese new authorizations are welcomed, the EU\u2019s average approval time for new GE crops in 2023 was\napproximately four years. In contrast, the EU\u2019s own legally prescribed approval time for such products is", "12 months (6 months for the review with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and 6 months for the\npolitical committee process known as comitology).\nAs of December 31, 2024, the United States was tracking approximately 30 agricultural biotechnology\nproduct applications (including renewals) submitted to the EU, including with respect to corn, soybean,\nrapeseed, and cotton. Of those applications, 29 were under scientific review by the EFSA and 6 await\naction by the European Commission through comitology. Delays in both of these stages contribute to\nincreasingly lengthy EU approval timelines.\nFor example, EFSA continues to demand unnecessary studies while conducting risk assessments, which\nresult in unpredictable delays in issuing final opinions. In comitology, repeated findings of \u201cno opinion\u201d\nby the relevant Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed also delay the EU from making", "by the relevant Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed also delay the EU from making\ndecisions on GE approvals, by requiring products to go through an additional assessment by an Appeal\nCommittee before receiving a final approval. The United States continues to engage the EU on delays of\nthis nature and urge the EU to address other barriers to trade in biotechnology products. For example, the\nEU has yet to establish a practical low-level presence policy and instead maintains a 0.1 percent limit for\nunapproved biotechnology traits in feed shipments, which is not commercially feasible and disrupts trade\nin products that have otherwise passed U.S. safety assessments.\nFollowing two years of consultations and evaluations, the European Commission introduced its proposal\nfor regulating plants derived from new genomic techniques on July 5, 2023. While the proposal received\na favorable vote from the European Parliament on February 7, 2024, it still requires consensus from the", "Council of the European Union in order for the proposal to proceed in the legislative process.

Under the transitional\nmeasures, Member States had until October 2015 to request exemption from the geographical scope of the\nauthorizations already granted or that were under regulatory review for EU cultivation approval. Eighteen\nMember States \u201copted-out\u201d of GE crop cultivation for all or part of their territories, and none of the five\nMember States (the Czech Republic, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain) that grew GE corn opted out.", "However, as of 2024, only Portugal and Spain commercially cultivated GE corn.\nSeventeen Member States have opted out of cultivation using biotechnology seeds. The 17 Member States\nthat requested exclusion of their entire territory from the geographical scope of biotechnology applications\nare Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovenia. Additionally, one region in\nBelgium, Wallonia, has also opted out of cultivation. All of these Member States and regions have decided\nto prohibit the cultivation of Monsanto 810 corn (MON810) and the seven varieties of corn that were\nsubmitted for EU-wide approval in 2015 (apart from Denmark and Luxembourg, which have only\nprohibited MON810 and three of the seven varieties of corn that were submitted for EU-wide approval).\nEU Fumigation Requirements for Hardwood Lumber and Logs", "EU Fumigation Requirements for Hardwood Lumber and Logs\nThe EU previously prohibited the use of methyl bromide to fumigate logs and wood chips imports.\nFumigation with sulfuryl fluoride is considered an equally effective substitute and is used throughout the\nEU, including for EU log exports. While the EU approved the use of sulfuryl fluoride for certain U.S. log\nexports in 2023, the decision on its use for U.S. pine wood chips remains pending scientific review, which\nleaves U.S. exporters of pine wood chips without a commercially viable fumigation option. Heat treatment,\nwhich is the EU alternative to fumigation, is not scalable in many instances. The United States will continue\nto engage with the EU on this issue to identify a path forward.\nPathogen Reduction Treatments\nThe EU maintains measures that prohibit the use of any substance other than water to remove contamination\nfrom animal products unless the substance has been approved by the European Commission. These", "from animal products unless the substance has been approved by the European Commission. These\nmeasures significantly affect U.S. exports of beef, pork, and poultry to the EU because the European\nCommission has failed to approve several pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs) that have been approved\nfor use in the United States. PRTs are rinses used to kill microbial pathogens that commonly exist on meat\nafter slaughter. The PRTs at issue have been approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\nafter establishing their safety on the basis of scientific evidence.\nIn March 2017, the National Pork Producers Council submitted an application to the European Commission\nfor the approval of two organic acids, lactic and acetic, for use on pork. The application was submitted to\nEFSA by the European Commission in September 2017. EFSA published its evaluation in December 2018,\nconfirming the safety of the use of acetic acid and lactic acid in pork processing. As of December 31, 2024,", "the European Commission has taken no action for the approval of pork PRTs.\nThe United States maintains that the use of PRTs is a critical tool during meat processing that helps further\nthe safety of products being placed on the market. The United States has engaged the EU to share scientific\ndata regarding the safe use of PRTs and will continue to engage the EU regarding the approval of PRTs for\nbeef, pork, and poultry as an effective tool to improve food safety.\n140 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nCertification Requirements\nSince January 2022, the EU has published at least fourteen versions of the health certificate it requires for\nU.S. agricultural exports of fish, meat, dairy, eggs, processed products, and animal byproducts. U.S.\nexporters are concerned about exporting products of animal and animal origin to the EU market and to third\ncountry markets that require transit through the EU because of the unpredictability of health certificate", "requirements. Differing interpretations of requirements among Member States adds to this uncertainty.\nThe EU is currently contemplating the addition of attestations related to animal welfare, which may further\ncomplicate this issue.\nThe EU has not provided scientific evidence to justify its certification requirements and subsequent\nmodifications. The certification requirements also are enforced irrespective of whether these goods are\ndestined for commercial sale in the EU or transiting through the EU. The EU\u2019s requirements often appear\nto have been established without scientific evidence, a risk assessment, or consideration of Codex guidance\non certifications, the latter of which recommend that official certificates require only the minimum amount\nof information necessary to meet the objectives of the country\u2019s food safety system. Moreover, the EU\u2019s\nchanges to certificates are increasingly frequent, complex, and instituted through updates to multiple EU", "implementing or delegated regulations, making compliance difficult for manufacturers, exporters, foreign\ncompetent authorities, and EU importers. Certificates based on the standardized templates published in EU\nregulations are a condition for trade, but it is increasingly difficult for U.S. regulators to issue the required\nEU certificates. Differences in interpretation of EU legislation by Member State authorities also create\nlegal uncertainty and often result in trade disruptions, creating additional burden for U.S. exporters.\nOn September 15, 2022, the EU adopted Regulation (EU) 2022/1616 on recycled plastic materials and\narticles intended to come into contact with foods, which entered into force on October 10, 2024. Article 27\nof the regulation requires the competent authority in the country where a recycler of food-contact plastic is\nlocated to verify that the recycler\u2019s food safety controls are in compliance with EU requirements and to", "perform facility audits. Article 27 of the regulation also requires that the competent authority receive from\nthe recycler a compliance monitoring summary sheet and verify that the information complies with EU\nregulations. The EU has rejected existing risk management systems implemented by component authorities\nin exporting countries, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201cNo Objection Letter,\u201d as\npotentially trade-facilitative alternatives. This regulation raises concerns with the jurisdictional precedence\nof an EU requirement to be verified by a non-EU competent authority and the lack of third-party conformity\nassessment options.\nThe United States will continue to engage the EU bilaterally to resolve concerns regarding the EU\u2019s\ncertification requirements.\nTitanium Dioxide\nIn November 2021, the European Commission published European Commission Implementing Regulation\n(EU) 2021/2090 in the EU Official Journal denying the authorization of titanium dioxide (E171) as a feed", "additive for all animal species. Following this action, Regulation (EU) 2022/63 prohibited titanium dioxide\n(E171) as a food additive in the EU as of August 7, 2022. The regulation includes a commitment to review\nthe necessity to maintain or delete titanium dioxide from the EU list of food additives for exclusive use as\na color in medicinal products. The European Commission originally tasked the European Medicines\nAgency (EMA) with reviewing the situation by April 2024, although the results of the review are still not\npublicly available. The regulation calls on the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate research and\ndevelopment for alternatives to titanium dioxide in both new and previously authorized products.

U.S. exports\nremain blocked because the United States and EU have not agreed on the conditions and format for an\nexport certificate. The EU implemented new animal health laws in 2021, and the USDA Animal and Plant\nHealth Inspection Service (APHIS) continues to explore alternative solutions, particularly with regard to a\nmutually acceptable animal health certificate, to resolve the issue of market access to the EU for live cattle.\nTrade in Raw and Processed Shellfish\nIn February 2022, the EU determined the U.S. food safety system for raw bivalve mollusks (shellfish) to", "be equivalent to the EU\u2019s food safety system for these products. At the same time, the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found two EU Member States to be\noperating a food safety system for shellfish to be equivalent to the U.S. food safety system. Trade was\nreopened for two U.S. states (Massachusetts and Washington) and opened for two EU Member States\n(Spain and the Netherlands), with an agreed mechanism for expediting the consideration of additional U.S.\nstates and EU Member States. In April 2022, the United States sent dossiers for Connecticut, Maine, and\nRhode Island seeking to export raw product to the EU. Although the EU committed to expedited reviews\nof U.S. state dossiers, as of December 31, 2024, the EU has not granted market access despite completing\nreview of the dossiers of Connecticut and Maine.

For such products, the EU does not complete a risk assessment. Rather, the EU discontinues\nauthorization for a particular product at the time of re-approval, as has happened for an increasing number\nof substances. The EU has also been taking a \u201chazard-based approach\u201d to new products, declaring them to", "be ineligible for authorization based solely on the intrinsic properties of the product, without taking\nimportant risk factors such as level of exposure or dosage into account. The United States is concerned that\nan increasing number of safe and widely-used substances are not being reapproved or having reasonable\nimport tolerances set for their use, due to these arbitrary cut-off criteria when current registrations expire.\nCategorization of Compounds as Endocrine Disruptors\nOne category of crop protection products subject to the hazard-based approach set out in Regulation (EC)\n1107/2009 are substances classified as endocrine disruptors (EDs). EDs are naturally occurring or man-\nmade substances that may mimic or interfere with hormone functions. The United States evaluates possible\nendocrine effects associated with the use of certain chemicals to ensure protection of public health and the", "environment. In contrast, the EU established an approach to regulating these compounds that appears not\nto be based on scientific principles or is maintained without scientific evidence.\nThe scope of trade effects of Regulation (EC) 1107/2009 is broad and overlaps with that of the other hazard\ncriteria and environmental criteria the EU uses in regulating pesticides. The EU obscures its hazard-based\ndecisions with onerous data requirements that allow the European Commission to claim an inability to\nmeasure risk. The United States continues to monitor this issue and raise concerns in international and\nbilateral fora.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 143\nPesticide Maximum Residue Limits\nMaximum residue limits and import tolerances are established under legislation, Regulation (EC) 396/2005,\nwhich, unlike Regulation (EC) 1107/2009, is risk-based rather than hazard-based. However, for active\nsubstances that are not approved due to the EU\u2019s cut-off criteria under Regulation (EC) 1107/2009, the EU", "may withdraw MRLs established under Regulation (EC) 396/2005, and reduce import tolerances to the\ndefault level of 0.01 mg/kg. The EU conducted an evaluation of existing legislation on plant protection\nproducts and pesticide residues through the Regulatory Fitness and Performance process. At this time, the\nEU has no intention to further align Regulation (EC) 396/2005 with the hazard-based principles of\nRegulation (EC) 1107/2009. As the number of substances ineligible for reauthorization by the EU\nincreases, and as the EU reduces the corresponding MRLs and import tolerances to the default level, the\nsignificant negative effect on agricultural production and trade is likely to increase.\nThe EU regulations also establish transitional periods to allow producers to adjust to changes in EU MRLs,\nalthough the transition periods established by the EU are generally not long enough to avoid trade", "although the transition periods established by the EU are generally not long enough to avoid trade\ndisruption. For many products, there may be a gap of several years between pesticide application and when\na final product is offered for sale, creating a situation where products that are compliant with EU MRLs at\nthe time of production do not have time to clear the channels of trade. EU products, on the other hand,\nappear to remain available for sale as long as they are produced prior to MRLs changing.\nThe United States has raised concerns over the EU\u2019s policy approaches for years and continues to engage\non these issues in the WTO SPS Committee. The United States is also monitoring the EU\u2019s actions with\nregard to evaluating and establishing import tolerances for active substances, which have the potential to\ncreate further trade disruptions when MRLs are set at levels that are lower than necessary to protect human\nhealth and are unnecessarily burdensome for trade.\nGlyphosate Renewal", "health and are unnecessarily burdensome for trade.\nGlyphosate Renewal\nThe EU requires that the approval of the active substance of a pesticide (i.e., the substance that works\nagainst pests or plant diseases) be periodically renewed.

Member States have various regulations limiting the use of products\ncontaining glyphosate. Despite the EU renewal of approval of glyphosate in 2023, some Member States\ncontinue to ban glyphosate partially or entirely, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,\nLuxembourg, and the Netherlands.

No. 1829/Health\nCertificate/FSSAI/Imports (2021). The notice states that the FSSAI will require a new health certificate\nfor the import of milk and milk products, pork and pork products, and fish and fish products. The certificate", "contains a number of duplicate attestations already required by the Department of Animal Husbandry and\nDairying (DAHD), but also requires new attestations that are not relevant to food safety or based on science.\nIn 2023, FSSAI and DAHD agreed to combine their certificates into a single document, but the new\nattestations remain. After several postponements, enforcement of the new certificate requirement for dairy\nproducts began in late 2024. India has indicated that it will continue to add additional commodities to the\nlist of products that require the new certificate.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 201\nForeign Facilities Registration for Agricultural Products\nAs of February 2023, FSSAI requires the competent authorities of exporting countries to provide a list of\nexporters of milk and milk products; meat and meat products, including poultry and fish; egg powder; infant\nfood; and nutraceuticals to India in the mandated FSSAI format.\nDairy Products", "food; and nutraceuticals to India in the mandated FSSAI format.\nDairy Products\nIndia imposes onerous requirements on dairy imports. India requires that dairy products intended for food\nbe derived from animals that have not consumed feeds containing internal organs, blood meal, or tissues of\nruminant or porcine origin and that exporting countries certify to these conditions, which lack a discernable\nanimal health or human health justification. This requirement, along with the recent dairy health certificate\nrequirements, new facility registration requirements, and high tariff rates, continues to hamper market\naccess for U.S. milk and dairy product exports to India, one of the largest dairy markets in the world. The\nU.S. Government continues to press the Indian Government, including through the TPF, to provide greater\naccess to the Indian dairy market.\nDistiller\u2019s Dried Grains with Solubles", "access to the Indian dairy market.\nDistiller\u2019s Dried Grains with Solubles\nIndia\u2019s regulatory requirements on distiller\u2019s dried grains with solubles (DDGS) remain unclear. Since\n2015, the GEAC has received at least 11 applications from Indian importers to import U.S. DDGS. Local\nfeed companies, along with the U.S. Government, continue to advocate that DDGS be exempted from\nfurther regulatory requirements, noting that DDGS are a processed product and pose no risk to the\nenvironment. In July 2018, the GEAC formed the Sub-Committee on Guidelines for Imports of Animal\nFeed to establish procedures for applications related to the imports of animal feeds, including DDGS. The\nSub-Committee submitted recommendations for approval to the GEAC in November 2019. As of the\nJanuary 2024 TPF Ministerial meeting, the GEAC has not officially confirmed that it will not regulate\nDDGS as living modified organisms.", "DDGS as living modified organisms.\nIn addition, unclear jurisdiction for the approval process for animal feed continues to complicate the\nprocess. For example, in December 2019, the FSSAI published Direction 1-95, announcing new\nrequirements for commercial animal feeds and feed materials that are manufactured, imported, or\ndistributed in India. Prior to the publication of Direction 1-95, however, the FSSAI had not regulated the\nmanufacture, import, or distribution of either commercial animal feeds or feed ingredients in India. India\nindicated it would issue an administrative order to clarify the formal regulatory authority of animal feed in\n2024; however, as of December 31, 2024, the orders were yet to be issued.\nAlfalfa Hay\nThe United States continues to pursue market access for alfalfa hay. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service and India\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer\u2019s Welfare held", "several rounds of technical discussions to address India\u2019s import requirements. In 2021, India and the\nUnited States agreed to a framework for bilateral market access for several agricultural products, including\nconventional and GE alfalfa hay from the United States. In August 2022, the GEAC issued a \u201cno objection\u201d\nto imports of GE alfalfa hay from the United States, and referred the matter to the FSSAI. In October 2022,\nIndia\u2019s FSSAI raised concerns regarding the approval of GE animal feed imports, including alfalfa hay,\nimpeding additional progress on this issue. The United States raised the issue at the TPF Ministerial\nmeeting in January 2024, and India indicated its intention to address import approvals of alfalfa hay and\nother feeds, however this remains pending.\n202 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nPoultry\nIn 2012, the United States commenced WTO dispute settlement proceedings against India\u2019s import", "In 2012, the United States commenced WTO dispute settlement proceedings against India\u2019s import\nprohibitions on various agricultural products from the United States, including poultry and poultry products,\nostensibly due to concerns regarding avian influenza. The WTO panel and Appellate Body issued reports\nin favor of the United States. In 2016, the United States requested authorization from the WTO Dispute\nSettlement Body (DSB) to suspend concessions or other obligations on the grounds that India had failed to\ncomply with the DSB recommendations within the \u201creasonable period of time\u201d to which the parties agreed.\nThe U.S. request was referred to arbitration. In April 2017, India requested the establishment of a\ncompliance panel, asserting that it had enacted a revised avian influenza measure that complied with its\nWTO obligations.

As part of the agreement, India agreed to reduce tariffs on certain U.S. products, including frozen\nturkey, premium frozen duck, fresh blueberries and cranberries, frozen blueberries and cranberries, dried\nblueberries and cranberries, and processed blueberries and cranberries. On March 15, 2024, the parties\nnotified a mutually agreed solution to the WTO. The United States is working with U.S. exporters to ensure\nthat they take full advance of these tariff reductions.\nPlant Health Issues\nIndia maintains zero-tolerance standards for certain plant pests, such as weed seeds and ergot, that do not\nappear to be based on risk assessments and that constrain U.S. grain and pulse exports. Bilateral discussions\nto resolve these issues, including at the senior official level, have achieved little success.\nIndia requires methyl bromide (MB) fumigation at the port of origin as a condition for the importation of", "pulses. This type of fumigation cannot be performed below 5\u00b0C/40\u00b0F, limiting its use at many U.S.\nfacilities, so the United States requested that India permit entry of U.S. peas and pulses subject to inspection\nand fumigation at the port of arrival, to which India acquiesced. India has granted a series of extensions\nallowing MB fumigation on arrival but has offered no permanent solution. In April 2018, the Indian\nGovernment confirmed the extension of the fumigation-upon-arrival waiver for U.S. peas and pulses,\nincluding chickpeas, indefinitely until both parties come to an understanding on the U.S. systems-based\napproach. The U.S. walnut industry requested a change to India\u2019s fumigation protocol to allow sulfuryl\nfluoride and phosphine in place of MB.

The United States is awaiting a response from\nthe Indian Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare\u2019s Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine and\nStorage as well as approval through notification in the Indian Gazette.\nGOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT\nIndia lacks an overarching government procurement policy and, as a result, its government procurement\npractices and procedures vary among different ministries within the central government. India provides\nprocurement preferences to Indian micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises and to state-owned\nenterprises. In all defense procurements, India\u2019s offset program requires companies to invest 30 percent or\nmore of the acquisition cost of contracts above the threshold value in Indian-produced parts, equipment, or", "services, which continues to be challenging for U.S. manufacturers, including those of high-technology\nequipment, to meet given changing rules and limited opportunities.\nIn June 2020, the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade issued the Public Procurement\n(Preference to Make in India) Order 2020, a revision to the 2017 procurement order mandating preferences\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 203\nfor domestically manufactured goods, including defense procurement. The rule was updated again in\nSeptember 2020, instructing each ministry or department to draft a follow-on order that favors domestic\nsuppliers, and permits mandated percentages to be applied to benefit Indian suppliers.\nThe August 2020 changes to General Financial Rules section 161 state that foreign tender enquiries may\nnot be accepted under $31 million and further reductions of the minimum requirements related to domestic\nproduction cannot be implemented without permission of an appropriate authority.

The 2024 Review of\nNotorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List) includes physical and online", "marketplaces located in or connected to India. The United States and India continue to engage on a range\nof IP challenges facing U.S. companies in India with the intention of creating stronger IP protection and\nenforcement in India.\nIn the field of copyright, policy uncertainty and ineffective enforcement remain concerns. Copyright\nholders continue to report high levels of piracy, particularly online. Court cases and government\nmemoranda raise concerns that a broad range of published works will not be afforded meaningful copyright\nprotection. In a positive development, in August 2024, the Department for Promotion of Industry and\nInternal Trade (DPIIT) under Ministry of Commerce and Industry, withdrew its September 2016 office\nmemorandum that extended the scope of statutory licensing under Section 31D of the Indian Copyright Act,\n1957 to Internet transmissions. However, concerns remain regarding the possible amending of Section 31D", "to require statutory licensing for interactive transmissions, as recommended by the Department Related\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce in July 2021, which would have severe implications for\ncopyright holders who make their content available online. The breadth of some licenses available under\nChapter VI of the Indian Copyright Act and overly broad exceptions for certain uses have raised concerns\nregarding the strength of copyright protection in India. Amendments to the Indian Copyright Act needed\nto bring India\u2019s domestic legislation into alignment with international best practices are absent.

Furthermore,\nstakeholders have reported continuing problems with unauthorized file sharing of video games, signal theft\nby cable operators, commercial-scale photocopying and unauthorized reprints of academic books, and\ncircumvention of technological protection measures. While the High Courts at Delhi, Madras, Calcutta,\nand Himachal Pradesh have established their own dedicated IP Divisions to handle IPR matters, the need\nfor such dedicated IP divisions in other High Courts and additional staffing and sensitization continues.\nIn the field of patents, several factors negatively affect stakeholders\u2019 perception of India\u2019s overall IP regime,", "investment climate, and innovation goals. As of December 31, 2024, patent applicants reported that they\ncontinue to face long waiting periods to receive patent grants, and excessive reporting requirements. While\nPatents (Amendment) Rules, 2024 include provisions that are likely to increase the efficiency of the patent\nregime and reduce current burdens on the patent applicants, concerns remain with respect to the currently\namended \u201cStatement of Working of Patents\u201d (Form 27). Among other concerns, the potential threat of\npatent revocations and the procedural and discretionary invocation of patentability criteria under the Indian\nPatents Act impact companies across different sectors. In the pharmaceutical sector, the United States\ncontinues to monitor the restriction on patent-eligible subject matter in Section 3(d) of the Indian Patents\nAct and its impacts. Pharmaceutical stakeholders continue to raise concerns as to whether India has an", "effective system for protecting against unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed\ntest or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical\nproducts. U.S. stakeholders also express concerns as to whether India has an effective mechanism for the\nearly resolution of potential pharmaceutical patent disputes.\nIndia\u2019s overall IP enforcement remains inadequate. U.S. brand owners continue to report excessive delays\nin trademark opposition proceedings and a lack of quality in examination. Finally, U.S. and Indian\ncompanies have identified trade secret protection as a growing concern and expressed interest in India\neliminating gaps in its trade secrets regime, such as through the adoption of comprehensive trade secret\nlegislation.

In addition, barriers to digital trade and electronic commerce, such as those imposed on\nelectronic payment providers, have secondary effects on a wide variety of services.\nAudiovisual Services\nThe Telecommunications Regulatory Authority\u2019s regulations on content aggregation and distribution do\nnot allow bundling of channels or certain types of distribution partnerships. Content aggregation is", "commonly used internationally, as it allows niche and foreign content to be bundled and sold by domestic\npartners without a large local presence or sales force. These regulations cause difficulties for small and\ninternational content providers because these companies must interact with each of the 60,000 local cable\noperators, radio broadcasters, and television broadcasters they seek to target.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 205\nThere are also some limits on foreign ownership in the audiovisual and media sectors, namely FM radio\n(49 percent), newspapers (26 percent), and digital media firms that upload and stream news and current\naffairs (26 percent).\nDistribution Services\nIndia imposes certain restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail industry. With respect to\nsingle-brand retail, foreign investments exceeding 51 percent are contingent on, among other things, a\nrequirement to source at least 30 percent of the value of products sold from Indian sources. India has", "modified the requirements in recent years, including by allowing firms to offset the sourcing requirement\nby sourcing products from India for global supply chains.\nIndia caps foreign ownership in the multi-brand retail sector at 51 percent and leaves to each Indian state\nthe final decision on whether to authorize such FDI in its territory. In addition, where FDI is allowed, it is\nsubject to conditions, including: (1) a minimum investment of approximately $100 million, at least 50\npercent of which must be in \u201cback-end infrastructure\u201d (e.g., processing, distribution, quality control,\npackaging, logistics, storage, and warehousing); (2) a requirement to operate only in cities that have been\nidentified by the relevant state government; and (3) a requirement to source at least 30 percent of the value\nof products sold from a subset of Indian enterprises. These conditions on foreign investment diminish the", "commercial incentive for multi-brand retailers seeking to invest in India\u2019s retail sector.\nIndia prohibits foreign investment in business-to-consumer (or \u201cinventory-based\u201d) electronic commerce.\nIn February 2019, India implemented regulations that expressly prohibit subsidiaries of foreign-owned\nmarketplace-based electronic commerce sites from selling products on their parent companies\u2019 sites. The\nonly exceptions for FDI in inventory-based electronic commerce are for food-product retailing and single-\nbrand retailers that meet certain conditions, including the operation of physical stores in India.\nFinancial Services\nBanking Services\nAlthough India allows privately held banks to operate in the country, the banking system is dominated by\nstate-owned banks, which account for approximately 60 percent of total market share and 67 percent of all\nIndian bank branches. Most privately owned banks are Indian owned, with foreign banks constituting less", "than 0.6 percent of the total bank branches in India. Under India\u2019s branch authorization policy, foreign\nbanks are required to submit their internal branch expansion plans on an annual basis, and their ability to\nexpand is hindered by non-transparent limitations established by the Indian Government on branch office\nexpansion. India caps foreign ownership of private banks at 74 percent and public banks at 20 percent.\nForeign ownership of infrastructure companies in the securities markets (such as stock exchanges,\ncommodity exchanges, depositories, and clearing corporations) is limited to 49 percent.\nInsurance Services\nIndia maintains an unlevel playing field in the insurance market.

As a result, many customers choose to buy LIC policies over those offered by\nprivate insurers, giving LIC an unfair competitive advantage.\n206 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nIn March 2021, India passed the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which removed restrictions on foreign\nownership and control of Indian insurance companies and increased the maximum foreign investment\nallowed from 49 percent to 74 percent. According to India\u2019s 2025 Union Budget, India will raise its FDI\ncap on the insurance sector from 74 percent to 100 percent. While this represents progress, it still is not\nclear if India will remove safeguards instituted in 2021. These safeguards require a majority of board\nmembers to be Indian residents and, if an insurer is incorporated or domiciled outside of India, to maintain", "a higher solvency requirement for foreign-invested insurers. These requirements also apply to any insurer\nincorporated in India that has at least 33 percent of its capital owned by investors domiciled outside India\nor 33 percent of the members of the governing body domiciled outside India.\nIn 2015, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) issued a revision to its\nregulations governing the provision of reinsurance services in India. The regulations afforded Indian\nreinsurers a mandatory first order of preference (or right of first refusal) for reinsurance business in India.\nIn 2017, the Reinsurance Experts Committee unanimously recommended that IRDAI implement a waiver\nprocess for life insurance products, which it did in 2019. Non-life reinsurance remains subject to a two-\nstep procedure where foreign firms can offer terms to cedents, but every cedent must then first offer the", "best terms obtained to Indian reinsurers. This results in unequal treatment for foreign reinsurers and\nconsolidates risk in a small number of Indian reinsurers, which is counter to global best practices of global\ndiversification of risk.\nElectronic Payment Services\nThe United States has continued to raise concerns relating to informal and formal policies with respect to\nelectronic payments services that appear to favor Indian domestic suppliers over foreign suppliers. In\nNovember 2020, the state-owned National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) announced a market\nshare limitation of 30 percent (measured by transactions) for foreign electronic payment service suppliers\nprocessing online payments made through India\u2019s Unified Payment Interface, which is owned and operated\nby NPCI.

In practice, DTH licensees have not\nbeen permitted to contract directly with foreign satellite operators and have encountered procedural delays\nwhen they have sought to do so. Rather, DTH licensees must procure satellite capacity through Antrix, the\ncommercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), which in turn only permits foreign\nprocurements if it does not have available capacity on Indian satellites. When ISRO does permit the use of\nforeign satellite capacity, the foreign satellite operator must sell the capacity to ISRO, which in turn resells\nthe capacity to the end-user with a surcharge.

The IT Rules require compliance by \u201csignificant\u201d social media\nintermediaries and platforms with five million registered users or more. The IT Rules impose a number of\nrequirements that U.S. stakeholders have identified as concerning. For example, the IT Rules impose\npersonal criminal liability on individual employees in cases where a firm is not in compliance with the\nrules. The IT Rules also include imposition of impractical compliance deadlines and take-down protocols.\nSince 2021, U.S. firms have been subject to an increasing number of takedown requests for content and\nuser accounts related to issues that appear politically motivated.\nShutdowns and Other Threats to the Open Internet", "Shutdowns and Other Threats to the Open Internet\nIndia has conducted a number of localized shutdowns of the Internet in recent years.

These subsidies, which are of substantial cost to the\ngovernment, lower the cost of production for India\u2019s producers and have the potential to distort the market\nin which imported products compete. In addition, producers of 25 agricultural products benefit from the", "government\u2019s Minimum Support Price (MSP) program, which utilizes one of the most production- and\ntrade-distorting types of support, market-price support. Rice and wheat account for the largest share of\nproducts procured under the MSP program and are stockpiled and distributed through India\u2019s public\nstockpiling system. India\u2019s announcement of MSPs can have the effect of providing a subsidy to the entire\ncrop by setting a price floor for India\u2019s farmers. The prices are announced before the planting season.\nTherefore, the MSP bolsters planting decisions, resulting in overproduction, limited demand for imports,\nand artificial export competitiveness.

India\u2019s public stockholding programs are controversial because the government\nprocures food grains and other commodities at guaranteed supported prices through MSP programs rather\nthan at market prices. In the case of rice, in particular, India\u2019s excessive subsidization through market-price\nsupport has gone far beyond its domestic food security needs and has helped India secure its place as the\ntop global exporter of rice, accounting for more than 40 percent of global rice exports in recent years. India\nhas notified the WTO that it is exceeding its WTO agricultural subsidy limits for rice for the last four years,", "but it claims the breach is covered under the 2013 interim WTO Ministerial Decision on Public\nStockholding for Food Security Purposes. India is leading efforts at the WTO for an expanded permanent\nsolution on public stockholding, which would allow all WTO developing country Members to use unlimited\nmarket-price support for purchases of any products associated with a public stockholding program. While\nWTO Members can procure unlimited quantities of food for public stockholding at market prices and the\nnumber of WTO Members utilizing market-price support for procurement is limited, India and others have\nframed the issue as a food security issue. In addition, in the past, India has used export subsidies to reduce\ngovernment-held stocks and has permitted exports of certain agricultural commodities (e.g., wheat) from\ngovernment public-stockholding reserves at below the government\u2019s costs.\n210 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nOTHER BARRIERS\nTransparency", "210 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nOTHER BARRIERS\nTransparency\nA lack of transparency continues to affect new and proposed laws and regulations, as well as a lack of\nuniform notice and comment procedures and inconsistent notification of these measures to the WTO.

In 2013, the United States challenged Indonesia\u2019s restrictions\nunder the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement procedures because Indonesia repeatedly failed to address U.S.\nGovernment concerns. On December 22, 2016, the WTO issued the panel report, finding for the United\nStates and co-complainant New Zealand on all 18 claims and finding that Indonesia was applying import\nrestrictions and prohibitions that were inconsistent with WTO rules.

This regulation also extends\nthe validity of horticultural product import licenses for 60 days into the following calendar year. However,\nMOA Regulation No. 5/2022 affirms the requirement for 29 imported horticultural products to have an\nimport recommendation (RIPH). MOT Regulation No. 8/2024 does not include the RIPH requirement and\nprovides that import licenses will instead be issued on the basis of available supply and demand data, if the", "commodity balance for a particular product has not yet been determined. In practice, this could limit import\nlicenses based on other regulatory requirements, including requirements for a letter stating the availability\nof adequate cold storage facilities for horticultural products, proof of control of refrigerated warehouses\n(cold storage), and a distribution plan or production plan.\n214 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nQuantitative Restrictions\nIn addition to covering some agricultural products, including sugar, under the commodity balance policy,\nas noted above, Indonesia exercises stringent control over the importation of these commodities through\nannual quantitative import limits based on domestic production and consumption forecasts. These import\nrestrictions are designed to protect local industries but have significant implications for market access for\nU.S. and other foreign exporters.", "U.S. and other foreign exporters.\nFor example, sugar refineries are only allowed to import raw sugar to produce refined sugar for the food\nand beverage industry, but only up to a Government of Indonesia (GOI)-predetermined annual allocation,\nand sugar mills are only authorized to import raw sugar to offset idle milling capacity. While some food\nand beverage companies are permitted to import limited volumes of sugar directly, these imports are subject\nto strict conditions, including a requirement to prioritize the use of refined domestic sugar before resorting\nto imports. This policy effectively limits flexibility for companies, constraining their ability to source sugar\ncompetitively on the global market.\nPharmaceutical Market Access\nThe U.S. pharmaceutical industry has raised concerns regarding the opportunity for meaningful stakeholder\nengagement in Indonesia\u2019s pharmaceutical procurement system.

Imports of U.S. rice under the OMA tenders are destined almost exclusively for government stocks.\nThe MAFF releases these stocks exclusively for non-table rice uses, such as industrial food processing,\nanimal feed, and re-export as food aid. Under SBS tenders, only a small amount of U.S. rice imported into\nJapan\u2014still identifiable as U.S. rice\u2014reaches Japanese consumers. In recent years, SBS tenders have not\nbeen filled due partly to the non-market-based price markup that the MAFF imposes on TRQ imports.\nAlthough Japan asserts that the markup is set using supply and demand figures and world pricing, it had\nnot changed the markup of \u00a561 per kilogram (approximately $0.40/kg) for six years, between Japan Fiscal\nYear (JFY) 2018 and JFY 2023. However, in the JFY 2024 third SBS tender in November, the markup", "Year (JFY) 2018 and JFY 2023. However, in the JFY 2024 third SBS tender in November, the markup\nreached the maximum allowable level of \u00a5292 per kilogram (approximately $1.93/kg), reflecting strong\nimport demand. U.S. rice exports currently make up only about 3 percent of all rice consumed in Japan.\nThe United States will continue to monitor Japan\u2019s rice import system in light of Japan\u2019s WTO import\ncommitments and engage with Japan on its SBS markup for rice.\nWheat\nJapan requires food wheat to be imported through the Grain Trade and Operations Division of the MAFF\u2019s\nCrop Production Bureau to secure the lowest tariff rate. The Crop Production Bureau resells the wheat to\nJapanese flour millers at prices substantially above import prices by imposing a markup. The United States\ncontinues to carefully monitor Japan\u2019s operation of its state trading entity for wheat and its potential to\ndistort trade.\n230 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nPork", "distort trade.\n230 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nPork\nU.S. pork exports to Japan are subject to a trade-distorting \u201cgate price mechanism\u201d that functions as a\nvariable levy. To prevent lower-priced imports from competing with Japanese pork, the mechanism levies\nprogressively higher duties on lower-priced imports. For instance, chilled and frozen pork are subject to a\nspecific duty of up to \u00a5125 per kilogram (approximately $0.83 per kilogram) based on the difference\nbetween the actual import value and a government-established reference price. This duty is in addition to\nan ad valorem duty that is charged on all chilled and frozen pork, regardless of import value. With the\nimplementation of the USJTA, the variable levy under the pork gate price mechanism is being reduced over\ntime for U.S. pork, but not eliminated.\nEthanol: On Road Biofuels\nIn April 2023, Japan implemented a revised Biofuels Standard that will allow the United States to provide", "up to 100 percent of Japan\u2019s annual on-road biofuels target of 500 million liters crude oil equivalent. The\nnew Biofuels Standard held constant the annual biofuels target volume, which has remained unchanged\nsince 2017. In April 2025, Japan plans to form an \u201con-road\u201d fuel expert working group to further develop\nregulatory policies and standards. The United States continues to urge Japan to increase its annual biofuels\ntarget volume to a level that would allow Japan to achieve at least an E3 blend rate (gasoline containing 3\npercent bioethanol). In November 2024, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)\nannounced plans to introduce direct blending of biofuels with gasoline as fuel for on-road vehicles. Under\nthe draft policy, oil distributors would begin supplying fuels mixed with up to 10 percent ethanol by 2030\nand 20 percent ethanol by 2040.\nEthanol: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)", "and 20 percent ethanol by 2040.\nEthanol: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)\nIn June 2023, METI announced plans to implement a target volume of 1.7 billion liters for SAF\nconsumption in Japan by 2030. Japan has a strong interest in using ethanol to produce SAF. However, the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization\u2019s (ICAO) current carbon intensity scoring model for U.S. corn\nethanol requires updating to accurately reflect indirect land use change criteria. The current scoring model\ncould negatively impact U.S. corn ethanol as a feedstock for Japan\u2019s future SAF production. METI will\nhold expert committee meetings to continue discussions of the agreed upon SAF regulatory framework as\nsoon as April 2025. In December 2024, Japan completed their first commercial SAF production plant in\nOsaka with the aim to begin sales to airlines in March 2025.

The United States continues to urge Japan to improve the speed of\ncustoms processing and to reduce the complexity of customs and border procedures. In particular, U.S.\nexporters continue to seek the coordinated pre-arrival processing by all border agencies of any shipment,\nby any mode of transportation, for which customs data is submitted sufficiently early.

The United States will monitor implementation and development of regulations to ensure\ncontinued science-based regulatory decision-making and a level playing field for U.S. exports of food\nproducts to Japan.\nPre- and Post-Harvest Fungicides\nJapan classifies fungicides applied pre-harvest as pesticides and classifies fungicides applied post\u2010harvest\nas food additives. These different classifications based on the time of application lack a discernable science-", "based rationale. Because post-harvest fungicides are classified as food additives, Japan requires products\ntreated with them to be labeled at the point of sale with a list of fungicides used. This requirement does not\nhave a significant impact on domestic producers because Japanese farmers selling their produce\ndomestically do not need to treat that produce for long-distance distribution and generally apply fungicides\nprior to harvest. The requirement may disadvantage U.S. products, because it inaccurately implies that\ncompeting Japanese products have not been treated with fungicides.\nMaximum Residue Limits\nJapan\u2019s procedures for enforcement of maximum residue limits (MRLs) result in uncertainty for shippers,\nincluding those who have never violated Japan\u2019s standards. Following an MRL violation by one exporter,\nJapan imposes enhanced surveillance on all imports of that product from the exporting country. If a second", "violation is detected during the enhanced surveillance period, Japan will detain and test all shipments of\nthat product from the exporting country, holding shipments until residue testing proves compliance. A\nviolation by a single producer from one country does not establish a systemic problem in that country and\ndoes not justify taking country-wide measures in response. The United States continues to urge Japan to\nadopt a risk-based approach to addressing MRL violations, and apply enhanced measures to all shipments\nfrom a particular country only when evidence indicates a systemic, country-wide problem.\nBeef and Beef Products\nOn May 17, 2019, Japan eliminated age-related restrictions on the cattle from which U.S. beef and beef\nproduct exports to Japan are derived, thereby allowing use of cattle that are 30 months of age and older.\nHowever, Japan maintained the requirement that U.S. exporters must hygienically remove those tissues", "Japan defines to be specified risk materials (SRMs). Japan\u2019s definition of SRMs is more restrictive than\nthe World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) guidelines provide for countries with a negligible risk\nfor bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety\nand Inspection Service (FSIS) regulations. Specifically, Japan requires that all parts of the head, other than\ntongues, cheek meat (Masseter muscle), and skins, be removed. Notably, this excludes head meat, which\nis allowed under WOAH guidelines and FSIS regulations. This restriction has necessitated the retention of\nan extra-regulatory third-party verification program, as FSIS does not verify the removal of the additional\ntissues. When Japan eliminated its age-related restrictions, the United States pressed Japan to align its SRM\n232 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\ndefinition with WOAH guidelines for countries with a negligible risk for BSE. The United States continues", "to seek Japan\u2019s alignment with international guidelines.\nPlant Health\nTable-Stock Potatoes\nU.S. potato exports to Japan are limited to chipping potatoes. In March 2020, the United States submitted\nan official request to Japan for market access for table-stock potatoes. In September 2023, Japan provided\nthe final pest list for table-stock potatoes. In the September 2024 plant health bilateral meeting, Japan\ninformed the United States that Japan is making progress on completing the pest risk assessment. The\nUnited States continues to engage with Japan on this market access request.\nApples\nIn 2017, the United States submitted an official request to export apples to Japan under a systems approach,\nwhich would provide Japan with a comparable level of phytosanitary protection to Japan\u2019s current\nregulatory approach and eliminate costly pest-mitigation requirements for U.S. exporters. The United", "States will continue to engage with Japan and provide capacity building on the requested systems approach.\nStone Fruit\nIn August 2021, Japan granted market access for U.S.-grown Japanese plum varieties, but Japan continues\nto impose costly fumigation requirements. On May 13, 2024, Japan approved five additional plum varieties\nfor import into Japan. The United States will continue to engage with Japan on phytosanitary topics related\nto U.S. stone fruit, including the U.S. market access request for peaches and revision of the fumigation\nmonitoring requirements for U.S. plums.\nGOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT\nJapan is a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA).\nJapan is obligated to open its GPA-covered government procurement tenders to goods, services, and\nsuppliers from the United States and other GPA Parties. U.S. companies in several sectors have expressed\nconcern that the Japanese Government sometimes uses technical specifications that could exclude U.S.", "products and services and, in some cases, may exert pressure on various entities to select domestic\ncompanies for procurement opportunities. The United States has expressed these concerns to Japan as they\nhave arisen and will continue to engage with Japan to address these concerns.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\nJapan generally provides strong intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, although a number\nof concerns remain.\nJapanese and foreign products are eligible for geographical indications (GIs) protection in Japan. Japan\nalso has recognized numerous GIs pursuant to international agreements. Exchanges of lists of terms\npursuant to international agreements have resulted in Japan granting automatic GI protection to certain\nterms without sufficient transparency or due process.

Some insurance\ncooperatives are regulated by their respective agencies of jurisdiction (e.g., the MAFF or the MHLW)\ninstead of by Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency (FSA), which regulates all private sector insurance and\nfinancial services companies. These separate regulatory schemes create a nontransparent regulatory\nenvironment and afford insurance cooperatives critical business, regulatory, and other advantages over their", "private sector competitors. The United States remains concerned about limited FSA supervisory authority\nover insurance cooperatives.\nProfessional Services\nEducational Services\nJapan does not treat foreign universities\u2019 Japanese campuses as equivalent to domestic higher education\ninstitutions for tax, scholarship, endowment, and research grant purposes. This has harmed the ability of\nU.S. degree-granting campuses in Japan to compete for students and faculty and deterred other U.S.\nuniversities from launching full four-year degree programs in Japan. Despite extensive consultations with\nauthorities, U.S. universities have only been offered the potential solution of becoming \u201ceducational\ncorporations,\u201d a status which would subject them to regulations set by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Education,\nCulture, Sports, Science, and Technology.

Additionally, they are excluded from participation in Japanese\nGovernment grant programs that promote international exchange and provide financial support for study\nabroad, and their faculties are excluded from applying for government-funded and other research grants on\nthe same basis as faculty at other Japanese universities.\nLegal Services\nIn 2020, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) introduced protections for certain attorney-client\ncommunications, a departure from Japan\u2019s general absence of such protections. However, the scope of\nprotected confidential attorney\u2013client communications is extremely limited, protecting only legal advice\nunder the Antimonopoly Act regarding alleged antitrust cartels, which involve price-fixing, market\nallocation, and bid rigging.

Many of the utility companies are also holding unused space on the grid for long-idled nuclear\npower reactors. Incumbent transmission utilities are required to allow power producers to connect to their\npower facilities unless they have a justifiable reason to deny the request. Given real grid capacity\nconstraints in some regions, utilities have begun offering renewable generation \u201cnon-firm\u201d transmission\ncontracts, which allow generators to connect to the grid and use available grid capacity in exchange for a\nhigher risk of curtailment during times of congestion.

Only Japanese companies held this certification as of December 31, 2024.\nDue to the length of the standard application process for the certification, this requirement created a de facto\nban on all U.S. and other foreign companies from participating in the 2025 auction.

To increase the supply of domestic wood products\nfrom 34 million cubic meters in 2021 to 42 million cubic meters in 2030, Japan allocated \u00a545.8 billion\n(approximately $303 million) for the Comprehensive Measures to Strengthen the International", "(approximately $303 million) for the Comprehensive Measures to Strengthen the International\nCompetitiveness of the Forestry and Timber Industry program from the 2023 MAFF supplemental budget.\nFurthermore, in 2024 Japan allocated \u00a5173 billion (approximately $1.14 billion) under the Forest\nManagement Project to support domestic thinning and selective logging operations. In addition, Japan has\nprovided funding for local governments to manage unprofitable forestlands. Starting from 2024, Japan\nbegan collecting the Forest Environment Tax from each Japanese taxpayer to cover the cost of this program\n(approximately \u00a560 billion, or $410 million, per year).

U.S. companies indicate they\nare experiencing delays in market authorization due to Japan\u2019s delay in the adoption of a well-designed\nonline system to process requirements and updates. Although there have been some improvements in\nprocessing time, there continue to be delays in the adoption of a monograph (or product standard) system\nintended to expedite the registration of such products as quasi-drugs under the PMD Act. As a result,\nproducts that contain active ingredients that are approved for specific uses in Japan, such as in anti-dandruff\nshampoos and skin care, may require up to six months to receive market approval. The MHLW is currently\nworking with industry and local prefectural governments to develop a monograph system (such as\n\u201cApproval Product Standards for Medicated Cosmetics\u201d), which lists the approved uses for previously\nreviewed ingredients and claims.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 239\nJORDAN", "reviewed ingredients and claims.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 239\nJORDAN\nTRADE AGREEMENTS\nThe United States\u2013Jordan Free Trade Agreement\nThe United States\u2013Jordan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force on December 17, 2001.

Under the PVoC program, an importer must obtain a Certificate of Conformity (CoC)\nfrom a PVoC inspection agent in its region designated by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS).

For U.S. food and\nagricultural goods, Kenya requires PVoC inspections on a consignment-by-consignment basis in the United\nStates prior to export. As an incentive to use the PVoC program, Kenya charges higher fees for destination\ninspection if the product arrives without a CoC from a PVoC inspection agent.\nCurrently, Kenya has only designated one inspection company, SGS, to perform PVoC inspections in the\nUnited States, further limiting the ability of U.S. exporters interested in selling products to Kenya.\nCertain products are exempt from the PVoC program, including raw materials, machines, and spare parts\nimported by registered local manufacturers; products certified by KEBS under the Diamond Mark of quality", "product certification; and products waived by the Kenyan Government through the Cabinet Secretary for\nInvestment, Trade, and Industry.

Instead, Korea now implements its PLS for", "in beef, pork, chicken, eggs, milk, and fishery products. Instead, Korea now implements its PLS for\nveterinary drugs, referencing only domestic MRLs or import tolerances (IT) set for veterinary drugs in the\naforementioned products.

However, Korea\u2019s\nNational Intelligence Service (NIS) has imposed additional domestic cybersecurity certification\nrequirements through its Security Evaluation Scheme (SES) since October 2014. Korea has broadly\nimposed the SES for Common Criteria (CC)-certified information technology products to be sold to the\npublic sector. In October 2022, the NIS introduced a three-tiered scheme dividing all public institutions", "into three sensitivity tiers. The NIS now allows institutions in the middle and lower tiers, such as\nuniversities and public schools, to use CC-certified information and communication technology products\nwithout additional domestic security verification. However, the SES still applies to most major public\ninstitutions, which account for over 90 percent of the public sector market, including all central\nadministrative institutions such as ministries and metropolitan local governments. The United States has\nurged Korea to abide by its obligations as a CCRA member.\nKorea requires network equipment procured by public sector agencies (i.e., government agencies and quasi-\ngovernment agencies) to incorporate encryption functionality certified by the NIS. However, the NIS only\ncertifies encryption modules based on the Korean-developed ARIA and SEED encryption algorithms, rather\nthan the internationally standardized Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in widespread use", "worldwide. Although ARIA and SEED are aligned with ISO standards, they are primarily used in Korea.\nThis restriction has de facto significantly limited U.S. suppliers\u2019 access to this market as it requires the\ndevelopment of a Korea-specific product line, which may not be commercially viable. The United States\n250 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nhas urged Korea to ensure that equipment based on widely used standards has full access to Korea\u2019s public\nsector market. In September 2024, the NIS announced it will also recognize AES and introduce a Multi-\nLevel Security (MLS) scheme in 2025.\nCloud Security Certification for Public Sector Cloud Service Procurement\nThe Cloud Security Assurance Program (CSAP) was created by the Korea Internet and Security Agency in\n2016 and elevated from administrative guidance to a legal requirement through a March 2022 revision to\nthe Cloud Computing Promotion Act. The CSAP, which applies to Korea\u2019s central, provincial, and local", "public sector with very limited exceptions, creates significant barriers to foreign cloud service providers\n(CSPs) seeking to sell to Korea\u2019s public sector. CSPs are required to create physically segregated facilities\nfor exclusive use by government-owned customers, comply with data localization of cloud systems, create\nbackup systems and data, and ensure that operations and management personnel of cloud service providers\nare located within the territory of Korea to obtain the low-tier certification. CSPs must also use only NIS-\ncertified encryption algorithms (ARIA or SEED).\nThe potential market from which U.S. providers are being excluded is large and growing. In August 2022,\nKorea began a review of the CSAP with a view to reform it in a way that would open market access\npossibilities for foreign service providers, indicating it would benchmark the U.S. Federal Risk and\nAuthorization Management Program (FedRAMP). On January 19, 2023, Korea revised the Notification of", "Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). On January 19, 2023, Korea revised the Notification of\nthe Security Certification for Cloud Computing Services to introduce a three-tiered scheme dividing all\npublic networks into three risk tiers under the CSAP, which still creates significant barriers to U.S. CSPs\nseeking to sell to Korea\u2019s public sector. Only those CSPs that have at least the mid-tier CSAP certification\ncan effectively participate in the government\u2019s digital transformation initiative. The United States raised\nthis issue on May 16, 2024 and urged Korea to align its cloud security certification requirements with other\ninternationally accepted standards. In September 2024, NIS announced it will waive the local encryption\nalgorithm requirement up to the mid-tier CSAP certification.\nOffsets in Defense Procurement\nThe Korean Government has pursued policies that prioritize local technology and products over foreign", "defense technology through its defense offset program. An offset obligation may arise for a foreign\ncontractor should the value of the defense contract exceed $10 million.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\nIn general, Korea has a strong regime of intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement. Under\nKORUS, Korea agreed to strong enforcement provisions for various types of IP rights and agreed to join\nkey multilateral IP agreements. Moreover, the Korean Government prioritizes IP protection, as Korea is a\nsignificant creator of IP. Nevertheless, some IP-related concerns remain, including with respect to: the\ntransshipment of counterfeit goods, especially via small express-shipped parcels; geographical indications;\nand a lack of civil and criminal penalties sufficient to deter IP violations. The United States continues to\nwork with Korea to improve these areas.\nSERVICES BARRIERS\nAudiovisual Services", "work with Korea to improve these areas.\nSERVICES BARRIERS\nAudiovisual Services\nNotwithstanding KORUS commitments not to impose new restrictions, multiple Korean Government\nagencies and the National Assembly have been discussing ways to incorporate online media streaming\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 251\nplatforms into the existing restrictive regulatory framework for legacy media, including potential Korean\ncontent requirements for U.S. over-the-top platforms.\nInsurance Services\nReinsurance firms are not able to transfer information outside Korea as required in their ordinary course of\nbusiness and as provided under KORUS. Korea\u2019s Financial Services Commission (FSC) informed the U.S.\nGovernment in 2022 and in 2024 that it changed its interpretation of relevant rules under the Personal\nInformation Protection Act such that U.S. reinsurance companies can send personal information of primary", "insurance policy holders outside Korea for purposes of data processing, risk management, and underwriting.\nIn a September 23, 2024 KORUS Financial Services Committee meeting, progress was made in clarifying\nimportant outstanding questions around the use of a revised consent form and changes to Korean law.\nHowever, there is no public written documentation of this upon which industry could rely for legal certainty,\nand U.S. reinsurance companies continued to report in 2024 that they have not been able to send information\ncross-border in the absence of such certainty.\nProfessional Services\nSince 2013, Korea has taken steps to open its legal services market, as outlined in KORUS. The amended\nForeign Legal Consultants Act now allows foreign law firms to open foreign legal consultant offices in\nKorea and to enter into \u201ccooperative agreements\u201d with Korean firms to handle cases jointly where domestic", "and foreign legal issues are mixed. Foreign-licensed lawyers and firms have been able to establish joint\nventures and hire Korean-licensed lawyers since 2017, but several requirements discourage U.S. companies\nfrom doing so. The Act limits a foreign law firm\u2019s ownership of the joint venture to 49 percent and requires\nthat the firms composing the joint venture have been in operation for at least three years in the home\njurisdiction. The Act also requires foreign and Korean law firms participating in a joint venture to establish\na new separate legal entity under Korean law. In addition, the Act limits the scope of practice of joint\nventures. These provisions undermine the legislation\u2019s purpose of facilitating trade in legal services\nbetween the two countries.\nELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS\nNetwork Usage Fees\nSince 2021, a number of bills have been introduced in the National Assembly that would require foreign", "content providers to pay network usage fees to Korean Internet service providers (ISPs). Because some\nKorean ISPs are also themselves content providers, fees paid by U.S. content providers could benefit a\nKorean competitor. Furthermore, such a mandate could be anticompetitive by further strengthening\nKorea\u2019s ISP oligopoly of three major providers to the detriment of the content industry. The United States\nraised this issue with Korea on several occasions throughout 2024.\nCompetition Policy\nIn 2024, the Korean Government, including the Korea Free Trade Commission and the National Assembly,\nconsidered proposals to regulate certain suppliers of digital services that meet global and national revenue\nthresholds. These proposals would apply to a number of large U.S. companies operating in the Korean\nmarket. The proposals also appear to apply to two large Korean companies, but exclude a number of other", "major Korean companies as well as companies from other countries. The proposals include a number of ex\nante prohibitions and obligations that would apply to companies to address competition issues in the Korean\nmarket. U.S. companies have urged the Korean Government to take a more deliberative approach to these\n252 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nissues, including by conducting a comprehensive market analysis to assess the level of competition and a\nregulatory impact assessment of the proposed measures. The United States continues to urge Korea to\nimprove its engagement with this sector by enhancing transparency and providing meaningful opportunities\nfor stakeholder input.\nLocation-Based Data\nKorea\u2019s restrictions on the export of location-based data have led to a competitive disadvantage for\ninternational suppliers seeking to incorporate such data into services offered from outside Korea. For", "example, foreign-based suppliers of interactive services incorporating location-based functions, such as\ntraffic updates and navigation directions, cannot fully compete against Korean companies because locally-\nbased competitors typically are not dependent on foreign data processing centers and do not need to export\nlocation-based data. Korea is the only significant market in the world that maintains such restrictions on\nthe export of location-based data. While there is no general legal prohibition on exporting location-based\ndata, exporting such data requires a license. As of December 31, 2024, Korea had never approved a license\nto export cartographic or other location-based data, despite receiving numerous applications from foreign\nsuppliers.\nData Localization\nThe 2011 Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) imposes restrictions on the transfer of personal data\noutside Korea. In 2023, the PIPA was substantially revised, and the Korean Personal Information", "outside Korea. In 2023, the PIPA was substantially revised, and the Korean Personal Information\nProtection Commission (PIPC) adopted an Enforcement Decree that took effect in March 2024. These\nchanges provide the PIPC with new authority to impose fines on service providers based on their global\nrevenue rather than revenue in Korea, and to order the suspension of cross-border transfer of personal data.\nThe PIPA permits the transfer of personal data outside of Korea only in limited circumstances, such as\nwhen the service provider has obtained a separate consent from the data subject to transfer data outside of\nKorea, when the recipient of the data has obtained a privacy certification recognized by the PIPC, or when\nthe data is transferred to a country that the PIPC has determined provides an equal level of data protection,\namong others.

This includes technologies in the semiconductor, automotive, robotics,\nand aircraft sectors. MOTIE does not allow the use of foreign CSPs for national core technology workloads,\nclaiming that U.S. CSPs may export data overseas. U.S. stakeholders have been working with MOTIE on\nnew guidelines for using cloud computing for companies working on national core technologies and urged\nMOTIE to release the guidelines as soon as possible.\nINVESTMENT BARRIERS\nKorea maintains various restrictions on foreign investment in the telecommunications and broadcast media\nsectors. Korean law prohibits foreign investment in radio and terrestrial broadcasting operations; limits", "foreign ownership to no greater than 25 percent in news agency activities; and limits foreign ownership to\nno greater than 49 percent in television programming and content distribution, cable and satellite\nbroadcasting services, and wired, wireless, satellite, and other telecommunications. Since March 2015,\nKorea has permitted U.S. investors to hold up to 100 percent ownership of a television program provider\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 253\nnot engaged in news reporting, multi-genre programming, or home shopping. Foreign cable and satellite\nretransmission channels are limited to no greater than 20 percent of the total number of operating channels.\nIn addition to these restrictions, Korea prohibits foreign ownership in the nuclear power generation sector\nand limits foreign ownership to no greater than 30 percent in hydroelectric, thermal, solar, and other forms\nof non-nuclear power generation.

Automakers also have noted that violations", "with respect to imports could be subject to criminal prosecution by Korea\u2019s customs authorities, which lack\nauthority to investigate domestically manufactured vehicles.\nPharmaceuticals and Medical Devices\nThe U.S. pharmaceutical and medical device industries continue to report concerns regarding a lack of\ntransparency in Korea\u2019s pricing and reimbursement policies and a lack of substantive opportunities for\nstakeholder input into proposed policy changes. Industry has raised similar transparency concerns\nregarding Korea\u2019s Innovative Pharmaceutical Company (IPC) Accreditation policy, under which the\nMinistry of Health and Welfare designates certain companies as IPCs that can receive tax credits, research\nand development support, and more favorable premiums, but does not offer an explanation to companies\nthat are denied the accreditation.\nThe United States continues to urge Korea to improve its engagement with this sector by enhancing", "The United States continues to urge Korea to improve its engagement with this sector by enhancing\ntransparency and providing meaningful opportunities for stakeholder input.\n254 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nLAOS\nTRADE AGREEMENTS\nThe United States\u2013Laos Trade and Investment Framework Agreement\nThe United States and Laos signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) on February 17,\n2016.

In addition, Malaysia applies high tariffs in\nthe automobile sector and has traffic restrictions and noise standards that affect the usage of large\nmotorcycles.\nIn its 2024 federal budget, the Malaysian Government proposed import and excise duty exemptions for\nimported electric vehicles (EVs) through December 31, 2025, and through December 31, 2027, for locally\nassembled EVs.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 257\nTECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND\nPHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS\nTechnical Barriers to Trade\nHalal Import Requirements", "PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS\nTechnical Barriers to Trade\nHalal Import Requirements\nMalaysia requires that all imported meat (besides pork) and animal-based products, including dairy\nproducts, obtain halal certification from an approved Foreign Halal Certification Body (FHCB) as a\ncondition of entry. Additionally, Malaysia\u2019s halal requirements are more prescriptive than relevant\ninternational practices. Specifically, Malaysia requires slaughter plants to maintain dedicated halal\nproduction facilities and to ensure segregated storage and transportation facilities for halal and non-halal\nproducts. In contrast, relevant international practices allow for halal food to be prepared, processed,\ntransported, or stored using facilities that have been previously used for non-halal foods, provided that\nIslamic cleaning procedures have been observed.

This process requires submission of an application with\nextensive supporting documentation for DVS review, which can take several months. Following the\napplication review, meat and poultry products are subject to plant-by-plant on-site inspection by DVS and\nJAKIM. For all products subject to registration, DVS requires additional documentation to make any\nadjustment to registration parameters (e.g., introduction of a new product in an approved plant and clerical\nchanges to plant numbers or addresses). Updating the registration can involve additional delays of weeks\nto months. U.S. industry reports that the registration system is overly burdensome, creates significant\ndelays, and is unnecessary in light of the United States\u2019 long history of supplying safe animal products to\nMalaysia.\nAdditionally, facilities that successfully complete the registration process with DVS continue to face", "challenges as a result of the extensive process.

This\nextension temporarily exempts PEMEX from having to sell only ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel throughout the\ncountry. Without the extension, PEMEX would have had to import ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel from the\nUnited States or upgrade its facilities to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel in sufficient quantities.\nIn June 2022, Mexico\u2019s Secretary of Energy announced a new policy that would require users of Mexico\u2019s\ngas transportation network to source natural gas from either PEMEX or CFE.

The measure has not been notified to the WTO.\nSanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers\nImport Permits\nThe Philippine DA requires that importers obtain an import permit, known as an SPSIC, and transmit the\npermit to the exporter prior to shipment of any agricultural product. Each import permit is valid for only\none shipment and has a limited validity period of 15 days to 90 days, depending on the commodity. The\nrequirement of one SPSIC per shipment with a limited validity period adds costs, complicates the timing of\nexports, and prevents the rerouting to the Philippines of products intended for other markets. It also\n302 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nprevents an exporter from reselling an imported product if the importer refuses to accept delivery or", "abandons the shipment. The length of validity and issuance appear to be based on the political sensitivity\nof the products, rather than on sanitary and phytosanitary risk. In 2019 and 2020, the Philippines stopped\nissuing SPSICs for certain imported agricultural products, including U.S. table grapes, chipping potatoes,\nand whole birds, along with products not currently supplied by the United States, such as feed wheat, rice,\nand corn. The Philippine DA continues not to issue SPSICs for whole chickens.\nPhilippine DA Administrative Circular No. 6, issued in June 2022, made permanent the 90-day validity of\nSPSICs for meat and poultry. Meanwhile, \u201cmust-ship-out requirements\u201d for garlic, onions, rice, wheat,\ncorn, and fresh/chilled fruits and vegetables remain limited to 20 days. SPSICs for frozen fish expire within\n30 days of issuance to institutional buyers and within 45 days of issuance to retail buyers. SPSICs for other", "plant, animal, and aquatic products are also still generally subject to 60-day validity.\nThe Philippine DA BAI issued Memorandum Circular No. 25 (2023), which reiterates that SPSICs are no\nlonger needed for cured processed meat products from eligible countries, including the United States,\nprovided they comply with the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) standards for the\ninactivation of viruses. However, SPSICs are still required for uncooked/not-fully-cooked/non-heat-treated\nprocessed animal products.\nThe Philippine President, through Administrative Order No. 20 on April 18, 2024, instructed that all SPSIC\napplications not acted upon within the prescribed period shall be deemed approved, consistent with the\nprovisions of the country\u2019s Anti-Red Tape Act. Administrative Order No. 20 directs the Philippine DA to\nprepare implementing guidelines on the issuance and processing of SPSIC applications for agricultural", "products, including rules and regulations on the extension and/or suspension of SPSIC processing. Pursuant\nto Administrative Order No. 20, the Philippine DA prepared a draft Department Circular incorporating a\nsection on the automatic approval of SPSIC applications, but only for commodities regulated by the Bureau\nof Plant Industry. As of December 31, 2024, the DA has not yet issued an approved circular.\nLocal Government Regulations\nSince the onset of African Swine Fever in 2019, and the return of avian influenza in 2022, a number of\nlocal government units have maintained restrictions on the import and export of live pigs and birds, and\nproducts thereof, that exceed both international and national recommendations.

However, to streamline regulatory processes among local\ngovernment units and align with WOAH recommendations, the Philippine DA BAI issued Memorandum", "government units and align with WOAH recommendations, the Philippine DA BAI issued Memorandum\nCircular No. 45 (2023), which enumerates requirements for the local movement of meat and processed meat\nproducts.\nCold Chain Regulations\nThe Philippines has long maintained a two-tiered system for regulating the handling of frozen and freshly\nslaughtered meat for sale in local wet markets. This system imposes more burdensome requirements on\nthe sale of frozen meat, including imported meat, compared to the sale of freshly slaughtered meat, which\nis sourced predominantly from domestically raised animals. A U.S. Department of Agriculture Food for\nProgress project includes a cold chain component in its overall mission to improve Philippine sanitary and\nphytosanitary measures and facilitate agricultural trade.\nIn June 2020, the DA issued Administrative Order No. 24 to add conditions to approve SPSIC permits by", "requiring importers to obtain certificates of availability of space at accredited cold storage warehouses and\nusage reports for imported meat and poultry. While the DA subsequently suspended implementation of\nAdministrative Order No. 24, this measure has not been repealed.

As a\nresult, the sale of frozen fish products is limited to institutional buyers, such as food processors and hotel\nand restaurant chains. The Philippine DA issued a suspension of the SPSIC and allowed canners to import\nfrozen bonito, round scad, and mackerel to stem diversion of these imported fish stocks to wet markets,\nthrough Memorandum Orders No. 14 and No. 19, issued on April 1, 2024 and May 8, 2024, respectively.\nGOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT", "GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT\nThe government procurement system in the Philippines generally favors Philippine nationals or Filipino-\ncontrolled enterprises for procurement contracts.

Stakeholders report issues with online piracy and\nsales of counterfeit goods, including apparel, shoes, watches, jewelry, perfume, and electronics. Such", "counterfeiting and piracy concerns led to the continued inclusion of Manila\u2019s Greenhills Shopping Center\nin the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List). Other\nstakeholder concerns include slow prosecution and conviction of cases. The government is reportedly\nconsidering amending the IP Code to adapt to new technological changes and improve IP protection and\nenforcement.\nThe United States continues to engage on the implementation of regulations related to geographical\nindications (GIs) that entered into force in November 2022, including their potential impact on market\naccess for U.S. products. As part of the October 2018 Joint Statement, the United States recognized that\nthe Philippines committed \u201cto protect GIs in a manner mutually beneficial to both countries by ensuring\ntransparency, due process, and fairness in the laws, regulations, and practices that provide for the protection", "of GIs, including by respecting prior trademarks and no restriction of the use of common names.\u201d In\naddition, the Joint Statement includes confirmation by the Philippines that it will not provide automatic GI\nprotection, including to terms exchanged as part of a trade agreement.

Nonbank foreign individuals and enterprises, like nonbank Filipino investors, are restricted\nfrom owning more than 40 percent of the total voting stock in a domestic commercial bank and more than\n60 percent of the voting stock in a thrift or rural bank.\nBanks that seek entry as foreign branches cannot open more than five subbranch offices. The Philippine\nCentral Bank ensures that majority Filipino-owned banks control at least 60 percent of the total banking\nsystem assets.\nInsurance Services\nThe Insurance Code provides that all insurance companies operating in the Philippines must seek to cede\nrisks to reinsurance companies authorized to conduct business in the country before entering outward\nforeign reinsurance arrangements. Moreover, insurance companies operating in the country must cede 10", "percent of outward reinsurance placements to the state-controlled National Reinsurance Corporation of the\nPhilippines.\nGenerally, only the state-owned Government Service Insurance System may provide insurance for\ngovernment-funded projects and coverage for all government properties, assets, contracts, rights of action,\nand other insurable risks to the extent of the government\u2019s interest.\nProfessional Services\nThe Philippine Constitution limits the practices of certain professions to Philippine citizens. However,\nvarious laws and regulations offer exceptions on a reciprocal basis, such as medicine, pharmacy, nursing,\ndentistry, accounting, teaching, architecture, and engineering.

Foreign retailers remain prohibited from engaging in trade outside their accredited stores, such\nas through the use of carts, sales representatives, or door-to-door selling.\nThe March 2022 amendments to the Foreign Investment Act reduced capitalization requirements for\nforeign-owned micro and small domestic enterprises from $200,000 to $100,000 if the business involves\nadvanced technology, is registered as a startup or startup enabler, or the majority of its direct employees", "are Filipino (assuming the firm has at least 15 Filipino employees).\nTelecommunications Services\nThe Philippines allocates and manages spectrum through the Radio Control Law of 1931 (RA 3846 and its\namendment, RA 584), Executive Order No. 546 1979, and the Public Telecommunications Policy Act of\n1995 (RA 7925). These laws and directives provide the country\u2019s legal framework for spectrum\nenfranchisement, operation, and permitting in line with International Telecommunication Union\nrequirements, and general provisions on the allocation and assignment of radio spectrum. While RA 7925\nrequires the conduct of open tenders in allocating spectrum, no public bidding has ever been carried out to\nallocate spectrum (e.g., spectrum auctions). Evaluation of applications typically involves the submission\nby an applicant of a letter of request to the National Telecommunications Commission for its spectrum", "needs.

Foreign investment in FINL-listed sectors may be prohibited outright (e.g., mass\nmedia, marine resources, and small-scale mining cooperatives) or subject to limitation (e.g., up to 40\npercent foreign ownership in natural resource extraction; educational institutions; private radio\ncommunication networks; companies participating in government procurement; and public utilities such as\nelectricity transmission and distribution, water and petroleum pipelines, seaports, and public utility\nvehicles). The 2022 FINL reflects amendments to the Retail Trade Liberalization Act, the PSA, and the", "Foreign Investment Act. Philippine Presidential Decree No. 194, issued in 1973, mandates foreign\ncompanies in the rice and corn sectors divest at least 60 percent of their equities to a Philippine company\nafter locally operating for 30 years. The Philippines has, however, implemented policies to allow 100\npercent foreign ownership in power generation and renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind,\ngeothermal, and biomass.\nSUBSIDIES\nExport Subsidies\nThe Philippines offers a wide array of fiscal incentives for export-oriented investments, particularly\ninvestments related to manufacturing. These incentives are available to qualified firms located in\ndesignated export processing zones, free port zones, and other special industrial estates registered with the\nPhilippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) and other Philippine Investment Promotion Agencies.

The CREATE Act grants a 10-year transition period to export enterprises registered prior to its\nenactment, with the option to reapply for special corporate income tax treatment subject to the conditions\nset in the Strategic Investment Priority Plan and a performance review by the Fiscal Incentives Review\nBoard. The Philippines signed the CREATE Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy\n(MORE) Act on November 11, 2024, to clarify the applicability of VAT zero-rating exemptions and further\namend tax incentives.\nOTHER BARRIERS\nBribery and Corruption\nCorruption is a pervasive and longstanding problem in the Philippines. National and local government\nagencies, particularly the Bureau of Customs, are beset with various corruption issues.

In\nresponse, Russia enacted a variety of measures in retaliation. The initial measures banned the importation\nof a variety of agricultural and seafood products from the United States and other countries.\nBeginning in February 2022, the United States imposed further sanctions on Russia in 2022 and virtually\nceased all bilateral engagement on trade and investment issues with Russia. Additional U.S. measures taken\nsince February 2022 have included: withdrawal of Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) status for Russian goods;\nincreased tariffs on certain imports from Russia; import and export bans and restrictions; financial and", "investment restrictions in certain industries; and blocking measures against certain entities and individuals.\nIn response, Russia has imposed or proposed measures to impact financial transactions, protection and\nenforcement of intellectual property, exports and re-exports of certain goods, and foreign direct investment,\nwhich may extend to nationalization of foreign-owned assets. Russia has also accelerated and expanded its\nefforts to replace imports with domestic goods and services. Additionally, as a result of the increased\ngeopolitical tensions, hundreds of U.S. companies have withdrawn from or significantly reduced their\npresence in Russia.\nBilateral trade in goods has fallen from $31.8 billion in 2012 to $5.2 billion in 2024.

The United States continues to engage with U.S. stakeholders to\nanalyze and assess the impact of the sanctions and counter sanctions on trade in the broader context of U.S.\nnational interests. However, due to the near total cessation of engagement with Russia, engagement on\nsignificant trade barriers in Russia is severely limited.\nTRADE AGREEMENTS\nMembership in the World Trade Organization\nOn August 22, 2012, Russia became the 156th Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). On\nDecember 14, 2012, following the termination of the application of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to\nRussia, the United States and Russia consented to the application of the WTO Agreement between the two", "countries. Russia\u2019s accession to the WTO signaled its movement to adopt key WTO principles, including\ntransparency. Despite its WTO commitments, as noted in the 2024 Report on the Implementation and\nEnforcement of Russia\u2019s WTO Commitments, the Russian Government has maintained restrictive at-the-\nborder measures, instituted behind-the-border measures to inhibit trade, and pursued principles of import\nsubstitution and forced localization, taking Russia on a comprehensive trajectory away from the guiding\nprinciples of the WTO.\nEurasian Economic Union\nRussia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), a limited customs union that also includes\nArmenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.

While tariff\nharmonization and standardized regulatory approvals across member states have eased the process of doing\nbusiness within the customs union for some U.S. companies, some regulatory regimes such as those\napplying to medical devices and to pharmaceuticals have not been standardized and still require approvals\nby the individual member states. As a consequence of its membership in the EAEU, Russia\u2019s import tariff\nlevels, trade-in-transit rules, non-tariff import measures (e.g., tariff-rate quotas, import licensing, and trade\nremedy procedures), and customs policies (e.g., customs valuation, customs fees, and country of origin\ndeterminations) are based on EAEU legal instruments.

Although Russia has implemented all the tariff reductions required by its WTO\ncommitments, some concerns remain.", "commitments, some concerns remain.\nIn 2018, the Government of Russia adopted Decree No. 788 On Approval of Rates of Import Customs\nDuties In Respect of Certain Goods Whose Country of Origin Is the United States of America (amended\nApril 26, 2022) imposing tariffs ranging from 25 percent to 40 percent on various industrial products\n(mainly certain types of construction machinery) imported from the United States. Russia took this action\nin retaliation against the U.S. President\u2019s decision to adjust duties on U.S. imports of Russian steel and\naluminum articles under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1862).\nThese retaliatory duties are being applied by Russia only, not by other EAEU member states. The United\nStates had been urging Russia to work with the United States to address excess capacity in the global steel\nand aluminum sectors, rather than engage in unjustified retaliation designed to punish U.S. workers and", "companies. On August 27, 2018, the United States launched dispute settlement proceedings against Russia\nat the WTO and requested consultations with Russia. Following unsuccessful consultations in November\n2018, a WTO dispute panel was established on December 18, 2018 and composed on January 25, 2019.\nOn June 16, 2023, Russia requested that the panel suspend its work. Despite an objection from the United\nStates, the panel accepted Russia\u2019s request and, effective June 23, 2023, the panel suspended its work. On\nJanuary 22, 2024, the panel consulted the parties on a way forward in these proceedings and each party\nindicated that it would continue to consult internally on the matter.\nThrough Decree No. 1173, on July 20, 2023, Russia increased customs duties on imports of certain goods\nfrom \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries, including the United States.

The law also allows Russia to introduce\npreferential tariff rate quotas.\nTaxes\nRussia applies a value-added tax (VAT) of 20 percent on goods, works, and services (with some limited\nexceptions). According to Article 149.2 (paragraph 21) of the Russian Tax Code, the 20 percent VAT\npayments on royalties paid for screening Russian movies (as defined in the Russian tax code) can be rebated,\nbut not VAT payments on royalties for screening U.S. (or other non-Russian) films. In February 2022,\nmost major U.S. studios withdrew from and ceased screening movies in Russia. Similarly, Article 149", "most major U.S. studios withdrew from and ceased screening movies in Russia. Similarly, Article 149\nexempts from the 20 percent VAT the royalties paid on software included in the Unified Register of Russian\nSoftware (pursuant to Federal Law No. 188-FZ of June 29, 2015, and Resolution 1236 of November 16,\n2015). Because only Russian software is included in the Register, the cost of using non-Russian software\ncan be automatically 20 percent higher than using Russian software.\nRussia\u2019s Federal Law No. 89-FZ (as amended), imposes a recycling fee to be paid on imports (since 2012)\nand domestic (since 2016) automobiles and certain other wheeled vehicles (including self-moving\nagriculture and industrial vehicles). The fee is determined by the age, total mass, and engine size of the\nvehicle. Purportedly, the fee was imposed to offset the reduction in tariffs. In September 2024, Russia\nsignificantly hiked the recycling fee, effective October 1, 2024, raising rates by 70 percent to 85 percent", "for passenger cars purchased for resale, light commercial vehicles, trucks, buses, trailers, and semi-trailers.\nThe recycling fee increased from RUB 3,400 and RUB 1,235,000 (approximately $37 and $13,323) in 2023\nto RUB 556,200 and RUB 2,285,200 (approximately $6,000 and $24,360) on October 1, 2024 depending\non the total mass and engine size of the vehicle for new passenger cars for personal use. For used passenger\ncars for personal use and over three years old, the fee remained unchanged at RUB 5,200 (approximately\n$56). From January 1 of each subsequent year, the rate will be indexed by 10 percent to 20 percent. The\nfinal amount now depends on factors such as the vehicle type, engine size, the car\u2019s age, as well as if the\ncar was purchased for personal use or for resale. Although the fee applies to both domestic and imported\nvehicles, concerns remain regarding the overall level and calculation of the fee for heavy-duty commercial\nvehicles.", "vehicles.\nRussia applies a variable excise tax on automobiles based on their engine size. For example, in 2024, cars\nwith engine power below 150 horsepower (hp) (e.g., a Lada, as well as some models of Fiats, Mini Coopers,\nand older Fords) are subject to an excise tax of RUB 58 (approximately $0.63) per hp. For cars with engine\npower above 150 hp, the excise tax rate increased from RUB 557 per hp to RUB 1,662 per hp\n310 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\n(approximately $6.01 to $17.93). Those rates translate to a maximum tax of approximately RUB 8,700\n(approximately $93.85) for a car with less than 150 hp, and RUB 84,10 (approximately $932.50) for a car\nwith 151 hp, and RUB 832,662 (approximately $8,982) for a car with over 500 hp (e.g., certain models of\nCadillacs, Ford Mustangs, Jaguars, Alfa Romeos or Mercedes Benz). Although the tax applies to both\ndomestically produced and imported vehicles, it disadvantages foreign manufacturers as Russia produces a", "limited number of high horsepower cars. In its 2022 WTO Trade Policy Review, Russia acknowledged\nthat it does not produce passenger cars with engine power over 300 hp.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nImport Bans\nRussia has maintained a ban on imports of certain food and agricultural imports from Australia, Canada,\nthe member states of the European Union, Norway, and the United States since 2014. The list of banned\nfood includes: certain beef, pork, poultry, fish and seafood products; fruits and nuts; vegetables; some\nsausages; and most prepared foods. Russia has since amended the list of products and expanded the list of\ncountries covered by the ban, adding Albania, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Ukraine, and the United\nKingdom. In September 2024, Russia extended the ban until December 31, 2026 through Presidential\nDecree No. 807 On the Extension of Certain Special Economic Measures to Ensure the Russian\nFederation\u2019s Security (September 18, 2024).\nImport Licensing", "Federation\u2019s Security (September 18, 2024).\nImport Licensing\nEven before February 2022, the Russian Government maintained barriers to the importation of products\nwith cryptographic functionalities (encryption products). Although Russia has WTO commitments to allow\nthe importation of \u201cmass market\u201d consumer electronics without an import license or other customs\nformalities (other than import duties), stakeholders report that Russia continues to require at a minimum a\none-time notification or, for products with strong encryption, permission from the Russian security services\nin addition to an import license, which significantly increases import costs and often precludes imports\naltogether. In addition, pursuant to Government Resolution No. 313 (April 16, 2012), as amended, Russia\nrequires an activity license to distribute encryption products, including many common consumer\nelectronics, which further restricts U.S. exporters\u2019 access to the Russian market. Only Russian legal entities", "or individual entrepreneurs may apply for a local (domestic) encryption license. Representative offices of\nforeign companies registered in Russia cannot apply for a local license. Prior to February 2022, the U.S.\nGovernment had raised these concerns with the Russian Government about the import licensing regime for\nencryption products but Russia failed to respond.\nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation\nIn 2019, Russia began to implement a mandatory labeling regime (track and trace regime) in selected\nindustry sectors that requires the application of an encrypted label to products, both imported and\ndomestically produced, in an ever-widening list of industry sectors. The mandatory labeling regime applied\ninitially to only certain industry sectors (e.g., footwear, apparel, pharmaceuticals, and perfumery products).\nIn 2024, eight new product categories were added to the labeling regime. As of December 31, 2024, Russia", "digitally traces 24 groups of goods, ranging from dairy goods, bottled water, medicines, and cigarettes to\nfive light industry product categories, with the goal of making most consumer goods digitally traceable by\n2026. Various affected industry stakeholders have raised significant concerns about the regime, including:\nshort implementation timelines; the risk of disclosure and misuse of sensitive commercial data collected\nunder the regime; the lack of operational details from the Russian Government; the quantity of detailed data\nrequired for the labels; the possibility of national treatment and trading rights issues stemming from\ndifferent procedures for importers to obtain these labels compared to domestic manufacturers; the\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 311\nrequirement that the labels must be purchased from a single Russian company; the duplication with existing\ntracking regimes (e.g., the system for tracking alcohol products); and arbitrary misuse of the system to halt", "imports. Russia had shown some flexibility in response to stakeholder concerns and, in 2022, suspended\nsome of the labeling requirements. The suspension was lifted in stages in 2023 to 2024.\nU.S. stakeholders report that the Russian Government does not publish all regulations, judicial decisions,\nand administrative rulings of general application on customs matters. In addition, U.S. exporters report that\ncustoms enforcement varies by region and port of entry, and that changes in regulations can be frequent\nand unpredictable, adding to costs and delays at the border.\nImport Substitution Policies\nRussia\u2019s extensive import substitution policies, which have been in place since before February 2022, have\nposed a significant barrier to a wide variety of U.S. exports and have caused a precipitous drop in trade.\nThese policies have a long history in Russia, but have increased in prominence in the past few years and", "transformed into a set of policy initiatives to ensure Russia\u2019s technological sovereignty by reducing its\ndependence on foreign technologies. Sectors in which these policies have been developed and implemented\nover the last several years include: agriculture; transport vehicles; telecommunications; consumer goods;\ntextiles; optical fiber; defense; banking; oil and gas; solar and wind energy; software; aircraft\nmanufacturing; and medical devices. (For further information, see the sections on Investment Barriers,\nState-Owned Enterprises, and Government Procurement.)\nInitially, the Russian Government implemented these preferences primarily through government\nprocurement, but, since 2015, has increasingly extended the mandated preferences to purchases by state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs). For example, Russia\u2019s law governing SOE purchases expressly: (1) favors\nRussian-produced products; (2) grants the Russian Government the authority to establish plans and tender", "rules for the purchase of specific Russian goods, works, and services; (3) establishes a Government Import\nSubstitution Commission with responsibility for determining which types of machinery and equipment\nmust be sourced locally for large investment projects by SOEs, state corporations, or certain private\nbusinesses; (4) requires the coordination of SOEs\u2019 purchases of pharmaceutical, high technology, and\ninnovative products with the government; and (5) recommends that SOEs follow the more restrictive\nprocurement rules that govern federal and municipal procurement. (For further information, see the\nGovernment Procurement section.)\nRussia\u2019s import substitution requirements have not been limited to SOEs. Since December 2019, Russia\nhas required the pre-installation of Russian software (e.g., search engines, Yandex browser, mapping and\nnavigation software, anti-virus software, software that provides access to electronic government", "navigation software, anti-virus software, software that provides access to electronic government\ninfrastructure, instant messaging and social network software, and national payment software) on certain\nconsumer electronic products (e.g., smartphones, computers, tablets, and smart TVs) sold in Russia. (Law\nNo. 425 On Amending Article 4 of Russian Federation Law \u2018On Protecting Consumer Rights\u2019 December\n2, 2019.) Stakeholders contend that the law appears to be another effort by the Russian Government to\ndisadvantage imports and increase control over technology. In August 2023, the Russian Government\napproved a new list of Russian software that must be pre-installed on smart TVs in 2024, adding several\nvideo streaming services. The list of programs for computers and mobile devices remained basically the\nsame. In addition, technology companies are concerned that the law would expose devices and services to", "potentially unsafe, insecure, or unreliable technology. The United States raised concerns directly with the\nRussian Government prior to 2022.\nRussia has expanded its localization policies beyond Russian-made goods to include Russian-origin\nservices.

Russia recognizes only the certificates issued by authorized agencies from one\nof the EAEU member countries with a representative office in Russia. Russian authorities require product", "testing and certification as a key element of the approval process for a variety of products; and in many\ncases, only an entity registered and residing in Russia can apply for the necessary documentation for those\nproduct approvals. Consequently, opportunities for testing and certification performed by competent bodies\noutside Russia are limited, which is contrary to standard practice and inappropriately increases the burdens\nfor companies exporting to Russia. Manufacturers of telecommunications equipment, oil and gas\nequipment, construction materials and equipment, and veterinary biologics, such as vaccines, have reported\nserious difficulties in obtaining product approvals within Russia. Other EAEU member states are in the\nprocess of adopting similar requirements.\nAlcoholic Beverages\nStakeholders have raised concerns about legislative amendments that affect Russia\u2019s regulation of the wine", "market, particularly Federal Law No. 345-FZ of July 2021. Stakeholders are concerned that certain\ndefinitions and provisions, such as limitations placed on wine exported to Russia in bulk and restrictions\non the use of certain ingredients, could create barriers to exports from the United States and other producers\nof wine. Stakeholders have also raised concerns related to limitations on the right to use certain\ngeographical indications (GIs) or appellations of origin, and the rules governing labeling (with follow-on\nimplications for labeling approvals). In December 2022, the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on\nAppellations of Origin and Geographical Indications, which contains requirements that can reduce\nsafeguards for the use of common names, came into force in Russia.\nIn addition, stakeholders noted that Russia requires one or multiple certificates for imported wine from the\nUnited States, even when those wines conform to both U.S. and Russian standards. Often, these certificates", "must be an original document issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury (Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and\nTrade Bureau) or an officially accredited organization located in Russia. Stakeholders also expressed\nconcerns about the Ministry of Industry and Trade\u2019s (MoIT) November 2022 decision to allow imports of\npremium liquor brands without the trademark owners\u2019 consent under Russia\u2019s parallel imports scheme.\nWhen appropriate, the United States will work to ensure that Russia\u2019s and the EAEU\u2019s alcoholic beverages\ncontrol regime is consistent with Russia\u2019s WTO commitments, and international standards or guidelines\nfor such products.\nPharmaceuticals\nU.S. stakeholders continue to raise concerns about the implementation of Russia\u2019s Good Manufacturing\nPractices (GMP) regime for pharmaceutical products. U.S. stakeholders are concerned that Russia treats\ndomestic and foreign manufacturers differently in the implementation of its GMP regime for medicines.", "For example, stakeholders have highlighted the higher rate of unwarranted denials of foreign GMP\ncertificates, the lack of a process for paper review of corrective actions for minor deficiencies, and the\ndisparate, legislatively-mandated treatment of GMP procedures for local and foreign sites. Moreover,\nindustry stakeholders report that the GMP certificates for veterinary drugs, required since September 1,\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 313\n2023, present a significant barrier to imports and could potentially close the Russian market to exports of\nU.S. veterinary drugs.\nToys\nU.S. industry is concerned about the arbitrary exclusion of certain toys from the Russian market as a result\nof the \u201cpsychological assessment of toys, games and play structures\u201d required under the 1998 Federal Law\nNo. 124-FZ On Basic Guarantees of Children\u2019s Rights to the Russian Federation. U.S. toy industry\nstakeholders have also raised a concern about the EAEU\u2019s ban on recycled content in toys, which they", "claim contradicts global toy safety standards and undermines the growing focus of the U.S. toy industry on\nsustainability.\nSanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers\nRussia has banned imports of most agricultural products since August 2014. In addition to the import ban,\nthe market access barriers discussed below are longstanding and continue to be of concern for the United\nStates.\nFood Safety, Plant, and Animal Health Standards\nRussia maintains standards on a wide array of animal products that are inconsistent with international\nstandards set by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), the International Plant Protection\nConvention (IPPC), or the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) without an apparent scientific\njustification. Findings of veterinary drug residues during Russian border inspection of U.S. meat and\npoultry products have resulted in trade disruptions, including the suspension of previously-approved U.S.", "beef, pork, and poultry facilities. For example, in October 2013, the EEC adopted a zero-tolerance policy\nfor beta-agonists, including ractopamine, and trenbolone acetate for beef and pork products. These\nstandards are more stringent than the Codex\u2019s maximum residue limits for these substances in both beef\nand pork. Russia notified this measure to the WTO in November 2017, and to date the United States is not\naware of any complete risk assessment. Although the United States has established a Never Fed Beta\nAgonists Program, Russia\u2019s prohibition of these veterinary drugs, including for products that are not\naffected by Russia\u2019s import bans, prevents U.S. exporters of beef and pork products from accessing the\nRussian market.\nU.S. exporters of agricultural products also continue to face systemic issues in Russia. For example, since\nAugust 2008, Russian and EAEU veterinary certificates require U.S. regulatory officials to certify that", "exported products satisfy EAEU sanitary and veterinary requirements and meet certain chemical,\nmicrobiological, and radiological standards. These requirements are problematic because many EAEU\nsanitary and veterinary requirements appear to be excessively restrictive and lacking in scientific\njustification. Similarly, Russia requests U.S. exporters to submit certifications stating that the United States\nis free from various livestock diseases, even where the product in question could pose no risk of\ntransmission. In other cases, Russia requires sanitary or phytosanitary attestations on export certificates for\nlow-risk food or agricultural products without providing scientific evidence of the risk justifying such\nmeasures. For example, Russia requires phytosanitary attestations for shipments of certain plant-origin\nproducts destined for further processing, such as corn for popcorn, even though such processing removes", "any potential plant health risk. The United States is also concerned with Russia\u2019s failure to remove certain\nveterinary control measures for lower-risk products. Russia maintains a ban on cultivation of genetically\nengineered (GE) crops and the import of GE planting seeds, as well as stringent import restrictions on\nanimal feed and burdensome methodological guidelines for the registration of GE products. The United\nStates has pressed and will, as appropriate, continue to press for the removal of these types of barriers to\nexports of U.S. plant and animal products.\n314 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nApproved Exporter and Facility Listing Requirements\nPursuant to a June 2010 EEC regulation, Russia only allows imports of most products under veterinary\ncontrol (e.g., meat, poultry, dairy, and seafood) from facilities on a list approved by all EAEU member\nstates. Pursuant to a bilateral agreement signed in November 2006, Russia agreed to grant U.S. regulatory", "officials the authority to certify new U.S. facilities and recertify U.S. facilities that have remedied any\npreviously reported import noncompliance. In practice, however, Russia has not consistently recognized\nthe authority of U.S. regulatory officials to certify additional U.S. facilities, and there have been delays in\nresponding to U.S. requests to update the list of approved U.S. facilities. Russia justifies its approach based\non the EEC Customs Union Commission Decision No. 834, dated October 18, 2011, On the Regulation on\nthe Harmonized Procedure of Joint On-Site Inspections and of Taking Samples of Goods (Products) Subject\nto Veterinary Control (Supervision) and the subsequent EEC Decision No. 94, dated October 9, 2014, On\nthe Regulation on the Harmonized Procedure of Joint On-Site Inspections and of Taking Samples of Goods\n(Products) Subject to Veterinary Control (Supervision). The EAEU has competence for facility inspections", "and approvals. The United States worked with Russian and EAEU authorities to negotiate an EAEU\ninspection regulation that allows the EAEU to accept the certification of additional facilities provided by\nsanitary and phytosanitary authorities in third countries that certify new facilities. However,\nimplementation of this regulation has lacked predictability and transparency because EAEU member states\noften continue to insist on conducting their own inspections prior to approving a facility, without providing\nany rationale.\nSimilarly, Russia maintains exporter approved lists. Russia has effectively banned the importation of U.S.\ndairy products since September 2010, when Russia\u2019s Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary\nSurveillance (VPSS) instructed customs officials to allow shipments only from exporters on VPSS-\napproved lists. The EEC has now extended this listing requirement to most agricultural products. This", "directive appears to be inconsistent with EAEU legislation eliminating the requirement that a foreign\nproducer be included on an approved list in order to be eligible to export dairy products to the EAEU. The\nlisting requirement continues to prevent U.S. exports of heat-treated dairy products despite the fact that, in\nMarch 2014, the United States and the Russia\u2013Kazakhstan\u2013Belarus Customs Union (CU) concluded\nnegotiations on a U.S.\u2013CU veterinary certificate. Despite its WTO accession commitment to eliminate\nlisting requirements for pet food and animal feed products, Russia also continues to require approved lists\nof exporting establishments for pet food of animal origin. The United States has worked, where possible,\nwith Russia and the other EAEU member states to eliminate the listing requirement for exporters, including\nheat-treated dairy products.\nGOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT\nOn August 8, 2024, Russia adopted Federal Law No. 318 FZ, effective January 1, 2025, introducing", "On August 8, 2024, Russia adopted Federal Law No. 318 FZ, effective January 1, 2025, introducing\namendments aimed at streamlining Russia\u2019s legislative framework governing restrictions on procurement\nof foreign goods, as well as various preferences for goods and services originating in Russia and other\nEAEU member countries. As of December 31, 2024, Russia was still working on a Resolution to implement\nthe provisions for Federal Law No. 318 FZ. The amendments include three main types of domestic and\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 315\ncontent procurement preferences: 1) ban on the purchase of foreign goods;2 2) restrictions on the purchase\nof foreign goods;3 and 3) minimum domestic content requirements.4\nThe August amendments replaced the \u201cthree\u2019s-a-crowd\u201d localization policy, which banned government\nprocurement of certain imported goods if more than two companies from EAEU member countries\nsubmitted a bid. Effective January 1, 2025, the amendment introduces a universally applied \u201ctwo\u2019s-a-", "crowd\u201d and establishes a 15 percent preference for goods and services of EAEU origin.5 If more than two\ncompanies from EAEU member countries submit a bid, goods and services with higher levels of local\ncontent will be granted procurement preferences.\nRussia continues to favor local production of medicines through its government procurement system. In\nNovember 2024, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Finance introduced a resolution to aim to bring together all\nprocurement restrictions and preferences related to medicines.6 The draft government resolution introduces\nthe \u201ctwo\u2019s-a-crowd\u201d rule in public drug procurement of essential drugs providing procurement preferences\nto pharmaceutical companies in EAEU member states that engage in full-cycle pharmaceutical R&D and\nmanufacturing. The draft decree came into force on January 1, 2025.\nIn 2016, the Russian Government issued Decree No. 832 (last amended in May 2022) banning certain food", "and dairy products from non-EAEU member states for federal and municipal government procurement,\n(including fresh and frozen fish, fish products, canned fish, salt, beef, pork, veal, poultry, cheese, cottage\ncheese, rice, butter, and sugar) and established minimum purchasing requirements of domestic goods.\nIn sum, Federal Law No. 318 FZ replaces resolutions that will be declared void and unenforceable\nbeginning on January 1, 2025.7\nRussia has expanded the reach of its import substitution policies into the technology sector. Pursuant to\namendments to Russia\u2019s national procurement law (Law No. 44-FZ), Russia has created a registry of\nRussian software. Foreign-made software not on the list will no longer routinely qualify for federal and\nmunicipal government procurement, unless no similar domestically produced software is available. In July\n2016, the Russian Government went a step further and issued an order approving a three-year plan to switch", "government agencies to Russian-origin office software. According to U.S. stakeholders, because the move\nto domestic software was not moving fast enough, the Russian Government in 2020 proposed measures\nthat would expand the list of companies considered Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), and thus\nextending to many private companies the import substitution requirements applied to government entities.\nIn March 2022, the Russian President signed Decree No. 166 to ban SOEs from procuring foreign software\nand information technology (IT) services for the CII that they operate. The Decree also bans SOEs and\npublic authorities from using foreign IT for CII starting on January 1, 2025. In August 2023, the MoIT\n2 Federal Law No. 318 FZ: \u201cList 1\u201d includes 150 categories of foreign goods banned in Russia. The amendment replaces\ngovernment resolutions No. 616 (April 20, 2020) for industrial goods for defense and national security and No. 1236 (November\n16, 2015) for foreign software.", "16, 2015) for foreign software.\n3 Federal Law No. 318 FZ: \u201cList 2\u201d includes 452 categories of foreign goods banned in Russia. The amendment replaces\ngovernment resolutions No. 617 (April 20, 2020) for industrial goods; No. 878 (July 10, 2019) for radio electronics; No. 832\n(August 22, 2016) for food items; No. 102 (February 5, 2015 for medical devices; and No. 1289 (November 30, 2015) for\npharmaceuticals.\n4 Federal Law No. 318 FZ: \u201cList 3\u201d includes 273 categories of domestic critical goods. The amendment replaces government\nresolutions No. 2013 (December 3, 2020) and No. 2014 (December 3, 2020).\n5 The amendment replaces government resolution No. 925 (September 16, 2016) that included a 15 percent preference for Russian\ngoods.\n6 The draft resolution would replace government resolution No. 1289 (November 30, 2015) which regulates procurement of\nforeign-made pharmaceuticals included in the Essential Drug List (EDL).", "foreign-made pharmaceuticals included in the Essential Drug List (EDL).\n7 These include: government resolutions: No. 616 (industrial goods for defense and national security); No. 617 (other industrial\ngoods); No. 878 (radio electronics); No. 832 (food items); No. 102 (medical devices); No. 1289 (pharmaceuticals); No. 925 (15\npercent preference for Russian goods); No. 2013 and No. 2014 (domestic content requirements).\n316 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nreleased a detailed action plan to ensure SOEs and public authorities meet the January 2025 deadline. On\nJune 13, 2024, Russia amended Decree No. 250 of May 1, 2022 \u201cOn Additional Measures to Ensure\nInformation Security of the Russian Federation\u201d to ban public authorities, state-owned and strategic\nenterprises considered CII from using foreign cybersecurity services from \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries starting\non January 1, 2025. The Decree also provides the Federal Security Service (FSB) with broader authority", "to monitor CII compliance with the new regulations. The original Decree banned CII operators from using\nforeign software and/or hardware. The operators are now also banned from using cybersecurity services\noriginating from \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries.\nIn March 2024, Russia submitted to the State Duma a draft bill to expand the list of companies considered\nCII. If the bill becomes law, it will extend import substitution and local content requirements already\napplied to government entities to private operators of CII starting on March 1, 2025.\nRussia is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer\nto the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since May 2013.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\nRussia remained on the Priority Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. Challenges to intellectual\nproperty (IP) protection and enforcement in Russia include continued copyright infringement, trademark", "counterfeiting, and the existence of non-transparent procedures governing the operation of collective\nmanagement organizations (CMOs). The United States is also closely monitoring proposals and measures\nundertaken by Russia to target IP rights for foreign right holders based in countries that have sanctioned\nRussia. Some of these measures have been implemented, including Decree 299, which permits Russian\ncompanies and individuals to forgo compensation to right holders for the use of inventions, utility models,\nand industrial designs under Article 1360 of the Russian Civil Code, if the right holder is a national from a\nlist of countries designated by Russia as \u201cunfriendly\u201d due to factors including publicly supporting or calling\nfor sanctions against Russia. Another measure, Decree 322, restricts the ability of foreign right holders\nfrom those same \u201cunfriendly\u201d states to collect license payments for most types of IP.", "from those same \u201cunfriendly\u201d states to collect license payments for most types of IP.\nRussia\u2019s inadequate and ineffective protection of copyright, including with regard to online piracy,\ncontinues to be a significant problem, damaging the market for legitimate content in Russia and in other\ncountries. Despite adoption of anti-piracy legislation in 2017, Russia remains home to several sites that\nfacilitate online piracy, as identified in the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy\n(Notorious Markets List). Stakeholders continue to report significant piracy of video games, music, movies,\nbooks, journal articles, and television programming. While right holders are able to obtain court-ordered\ninjunctions against websites and smartphone applications offering infringing content, investigations and\nprosecutions of the owners of the large commercial websites distributing pirated material, including\nsoftware, are lacking.", "software, are lacking.\nTrade in counterfeit goods causes significant financial losses for U.S. right holders and legitimate\nbusinesses. Russia remains a thriving market for counterfeit goods sourced from China. Despite increased\nseizures by the Russian Federal Customs Service, certain policies hamper IP enforcement efforts. For\nexample, the \u201creturn to sender\u201d policy for small consignments, which returns counterfeit goods to their\nproducer, is problematic because it does not remove such goods from channels of commerce.\nCMOs for copyright can play an important role in ensuring compensation for right holders when CMO\npractices are fair, efficient, transparent, and accountable. However, royalty collection by CMOs in Russia\ncontinues to lack transparency and lags behind international standards. Reports indicate that right holders\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 317\nare denied detailed accounting reports, making it difficult to verify how much money is being collected and", "distributed. Also, right holders are excluded from the selection and management of CMOs.\nFinally, the United States is concerned about Russia\u2019s implementation of its WTO commitments related to\nthe protection against the unfair commercial use, as well as the unauthorized disclosure, of undisclosed test\nor other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. Stakeholders report that\nRussia is eroding protections for undisclosed data and lacks an effective mechanism for the early resolution\nof potential pharmaceutical patent disputes. Stakeholders also continue to express concerns regarding\ncertain evidentiary standards applied by the judiciary.\nSERVICES BARRIERS\nRussia has extended its import substitution policies beyond the provision of goods to include the provision\nof services.\nAudiovisual Services\nIn January 2022, the Russian Government announced that it would require any streaming service with over", "100,000 daily users to register as a Russian company and to add 20 Russian television channels to its\nservice, including Russian news stations, thereby forcing U.S. suppliers to become platforms for Russian\nstate propaganda. However, affected U.S. companies suspended operations in Russia before the measure\nwent into effect.\nFinancial Services\nOn August 8, 2024, Russia approved amendments to Federal Law No. 395-1 \u201cOn Banks and Banking\nActivities\u201d to allow foreign banks from both \u201cfriendly\u201d and \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries to open branches in\nRussia, but no more than one branch. Foreign bank branches may now provide banking services in Russia\nto corporate entities, but they do not have the right to conduct banking operations with individuals, except\nfor the transfer of funds without opening a bank account and the purchase and sale of foreign currency are\nonly allowed to make fund transfers without opening a bank account.\nELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS", "ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS\nShutdowns and Other Threats to the Open Internet\nRussia has regularly restricted access to information and services, and imposed periodic Internet shutdowns,\ndisrupting commercial operations, and thereby undermining a free and open Internet and impeding trade in\nthe digital economy. Many U.S. websites and applications remain blocked and Russia continues to restrict\naccess to virtual private networks (VPNs). Russia continues to develop its own domain name system (DNS)\nservice, which will centralize control of all internet traffic and further their ability to restrict access to the\nglobal Internet. The United States continues to monitor the impact of these events on U.S. trade and\ninvestment, including services exports.\nData Localization Requirements\nIn 2016, Russia began to enforce the first step of its data localization regime. By 2020, the Russian", "Government had implemented a regime requiring certain electronically-collected data about Russian\ncitizens to be processed and stored in Russia. This has imposed significant operational challenges on\nproviders of data-intensive services, as well as on manufacturers who rely on those services. The\n318 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nrequirements also raise concerns about state surveillance. Russia also requires certain telecommunications\nand Internet service providers (ISPs) to store certain communications content locally for six months and to\nstore metadata for such content for one year or longer, depending on the type of provider (Yarovaya law8),\ngiving the Russian security services the opportunity to request those data.\nOther Digital Trade Issues\nRussian ISPs must install a special device on their servers to allow the Russian security services to track all\ncredit card transactions. Russia threatens to shut off market access to ISPs that allow their customers to use", "virtual private networks (VPNs). In addition to the obvious concerns over state surveillance, industry\nstakeholders contend that the effects of these laws limit their ability to offer a variety of services in Russia\nand increase the cost of doing business in Russia, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises\n(SMEs). Moreover, the Yarovaya law may require ISPs to provide excessive access to citizens\u2019 private\ninformation, which raises privacy concerns.\nIn 2021, Russia implemented the so-called Landing Law which requires certain IT companies (i.e., any\ncompany with a website or an application with more than 500,000 daily users) to establish a physical\npresence in Russia. U.S. companies, particularly SMEs, contend that this local presence requirement,\ncoupled with difficult compliance requirements, harsh penalties, and concerns about staff safety, can\nconstrain their ability to operate their businesses in Russia. As of December 2023, the Landing Law was", "dramatically tightened with a special focus on global web hosting and cloud storage providers. In addition\nto opening a Russian office and local bank account, foreign hosting and cloud service providers are now\nobligated to specially register with the Federal Tax Service and identify their clients.\nINVESTMENT BARRIERS\nWith the imposition of sanctions by the U.S. Government, numerous U.S. companies have withdrawn from\nthe Russian market or severely limited operations. For companies with a continued presence in Russia,\ncorruption, lack of transparency, inability to repatriate capital, and the threat of creeping expropriation\nremain impediments to a stable and predictable investment environment for U.S. investors. In 2022, Russia\nintroduced significant restrictions on cross-border transactions, such as the sale of shares, payment of\ndividends, and liquidation of Russian entities controlled by persons from jurisdictions deemed \u201cunfriendly\u201d", "by the Russian Government. Further obstacles to investment in Russia include: problems with enforcing\nthe rule of law; restrictions on foreign ownership of agricultural land and land in border areas and on\ninvestment in the mining and mineral extraction sectors; inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms; weak\ncorporate governance, including the protection of minority shareholder rights; and the absence of\nrequirements for all companies and banks to adhere to accounting standards consistent with international\nnorms. In 2023, Russia continued to adopt a variety of measures restricting the business affairs of foreign\ninvestors from \u201cunfriendly\u201d states (e.g., limiting disclosure requirements in certain sectors, allowing\npayment of financial obligations in rubles rather than dollars, limiting certain transactions in sensitive\nsectors, placing Russian assets of several foreign companies which Russia claims will be under temporary", "control of the Federal Agency for State Property Management, and setting additional conditions for the exit\nof foreign companies from Russia). Finally, despite the existence of an Anticorruption Council and\nanticorruption legislation, with the departure of many international companies and the growing role of the\nstate in the domestic economy, corruption is an increasing concern in Russia.\n8 The Yarovaya Law (or Yarovaya package) consists of two federal bills passed in 2016 which amended previous counter terrorism\nand public safety measures. The legislation expanded the authority of law enforcement agencies, new requirements for data\ncollection and other restrictions.\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 319\nOn May 23, 2024, Russia issued Decree 442 (\u201cOn the Special Procedure for Compensation for Damage\ncaused to the Russian Federation and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation in Connection with the", "Unfriendly Actions of the United States\u201d), which establishes a framework to compensate the Russian\nGovernment and the Russian Central Bank for losses from the seizure of Russian sovereign assets by the\nU.S. Government. Under this framework, on October 10, 2024, Russia further tightened the rules for\nforeign company exits from Russia, including by increasing the minimum discount for transactions\ninvolving the sale of assets in Russia by foreigners from 50 percent to 60 percent. This decision also raised\nthe \u201cexit tax\u201d from 15 percent to 35 percent of asset value and added a requirement of Presidential approval\nfor transactions worth more than 50 billion RUB (approximately $539 million).\nInvestment Taxes\nU.S. companies have raised concerns about Russian tax authorities\u2019 scrutiny of payments that cross Russia\u2019s\nborders, but remain, for tax purposes, in the legal structure of the same Russian company. This issue has", "arisen when a multinational company transfers an employee temporarily to the company\u2019s Russian office\nfrom an office outside Russia. Under internationally accepted accounting standards, these normal business\npractices are handled as an intra-firm payment from one office to the other, or to the headquarters in the\ncase of royalty payments. However, Russian tax inspectors have in the past disputed such expenses as\neconomically unjustified and, consequently, impermissible under the Russian Tax Code.\nSUBSIDIES\nRussia is not permitted to subsidize exports of agricultural products pursuant to its WTO accession\ncommitments. However, U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential cost advantage to\ncertain Russian agricultural producers resulting from the provision of subsidies for the transportation of\nagricultural products, including for the transportation of wheat, barley, and corn from interior regions", "toward export destinations. Russia has provided this subsidy since 2017, stating the measure is intended to\nstimulate the movement of grain exports, stabilize domestic grain prices, and support profit margins of\nagricultural producers. In August 2023, Russia relaxed the eligibility criteria for railroad transportation\nsubsidies available for producers of agricultural goods and fertilizers. The United States is concerned that\nthis measure directly or indirectly subsidizes exports of Russian agricultural products. The implementing\ndecree No. 1104, dated September 15, 2017, specifically mentions several border crossings with Mongolia\nand China and authorizes the Russian Export Center (REC) to administer the subsidy. According to Russia,\nthe REC is a state export promotion institution that provides financial and non-financial export support both\nto agricultural and non-agricultural value-added products.\nSTATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES", "to agricultural and non-agricultural value-added products.\nSTATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES\nRussia\u2019s numerous SOEs play a prominent role across much of the Russian economy. The Russian\nAcademy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) estimated in May 2023 that the\nstate\u2019s share in the economy had grown from 47.3 percent in 2016 to 56.2 percent in 2021. While private\nenterprises are theoretically allowed to compete with SOEs on the same terms and conditions, in practice,\nthe competitive playing field is distorted in favor of SOEs. These advantages result from SOEs\u2019 lack of\ntransparency and lack of independence. The presence of senior Russian Government officials on their\nboards of directors, government subsidies, preferential lending by state-owned banks, misalignment of\nmanagers\u2019 incentives and company performance, inadequate control mechanisms on managers\u2019 total\nremuneration or their use of assets transferred by the government to the SOEs, and minimal disclosure", "requirements further distort the competitive landscape.\n320 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nA specific variant of SOEs, state corporations, are completely owned by the government and operate under\nseparate legislation and in a marketplace distorted in their favor. For example, state corporation holding\nstructures and management arrangements (e.g., senior government officials as board members) create\nconditions for preferential treatment and leave significant scope for discretion and lobbying by company\ninsiders, which disadvantage private enterprises. There are six state corporations: Rosatom, VEB, Fund\nfor Communal Housing, Deposit Insurance Agency, Roskosmos, and Rostec.\nIn order to spur growth and boost revenue through privatizations, the Russian Government in October 2024\ndecided to extend its existing three-year privatization program through 2027. From 2025 to 2027, Russia\nplans to fully privatize 20 federal state unitary enterprises and sell its stakes in 166 joint stock companies", "and seven limited liability companies. As of December 31, 2024, the Russian Government still owned 269\nfederal state unitary enterprises, as well as stakes of various sizes in 723 SOEs. As of December 31, 2024,\nthe Russian Government still maintained a list of 55 SOEs with \u201cnational significance\u201d that are either\nwholly or partially owned by Russia and whose privatization is permitted only with a special governmental\ndecree, including Aeroflot, Rosneft, Rosneftegaz, Transneft, Russian Railways, and VTB. However,\nRussia has been slow in implementing the privatization plan. The treatment of foreign investors in\nprivatizations conducted to date has been inconsistent, with foreign participation at times confined to\nminority stakes, which creates concerns about protection for minority shareholders and corporate\ngovernance.\nOTHER BARRIERS\nExport Policies\nNotwithstanding its stated intent of reducing export duties following its accession to the WTO in 2012,", "Russia in 2022 began to impose various export restrictions on a wide variety of products. For example, in\nMarch 2022, Russia imposed a temporary ban on exports of over 200 types of industrial products including\ntechnological, communications and medical equipment, vehicles, agricultural machinery, and electrical\nequipment covering over 1,600 items, in total. In December 2023, the Russian Government extended the\nban through the end of 2025. In May 2023, the list of industrial products subject to the ban was narrowed\nby about 200 items. In addition, notwithstanding the global food security crisis, Russia has imposed\ntemporary export restrictions (e.g., export bans, export quotas, or export duties) on sunflower seeds,\nsoybeans, grain crops, white sugar, raw cane sugar, rice and rice cereal, rapeseed, millet, buckwheat, meslin,\ncereal and cereal pellets, crude flour, barley, rye, corn, onions, garlic, turnips, sunflower oil and bagasse,", "fish products, sulfur used to produce sulfur-containing fertilizers, sulfur containing fertilizer, nitrogen-\ncontaining fertilizer. Other temporary export restrictions include non-agricultural products such as certain\ntypes of logs, ferrous waste and scrap, stainless scrap and waste, waste and scrap of other alloy steel, and\nwaste and scrap of tungsten.

This Agreement is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between\nthe United States and Tunisia.\nIMPORT POLICIES\nTariffs\nTunisia\u2019s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 19.5 percent in 2023 (latest data\navailable). Tunisia\u2019s average MFN applied tariff rate was 30.3 percent for agricultural products and 17.8\npercent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Tunisia has bound 58 percent of its\ntariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 57.9 percent.\nGoods imported into Tunisia can be subject to tariff rates as high as 200 percent. Agricultural goods are\nsubject to tariffs ranging from zero percent to 50 percent, with most agricultural imports within the 25", "percent to 50 percent range. All imported goods subject to tariffs are assessed a customs administrative fee\namounting to three percent of the total duties paid on the imported good.\nThe 2022 Budget Law instituted 20 percent to 50 percent tariff increases on consumer products that have\nlocally-manufactured equivalents. The law also included higher tariffs on some goods with no local\nequivalent such as bananas (from zero percent to 50 percent), mobile phones (from zero percent to 20\npercent), coffee (from 36 percent to 50 percent), and cosmetic products and perfumes (from 30 percent 43\npercent). Tariffs increased to 50 percent on imported apparel and bedding, shoes, and food products such\nas cheese, honey, chocolate, candies, juices, beer, and wine. Tariffs also increased to 43 percent on\nconstruction materials and products with local equivalents such as marble, gypsum, paint, wood, aluminum,\nceramics, glassware, and tools.", "ceramics, glassware, and tools.\nThe 2023 Budget Law, passed on December 22, 2022, eliminated tariffs on milk powder and butter and\nimplemented a 50 percent customs duty reduction on hybrid cars and full duty exemption on electric\nvehicles.\nThe 2024 Budget Law, passed on December 12, 2023, reduced tariffs on almonds, and pistachios from 50\npercent to 36 percent and implemented a tariff exemption on forage products. The law also increased tariffs\non selected dairy products from $0.50/kg to $1/kg, on fruit and nut flours to 36 percent, and on solar panel\nmodules from 10 percent to 30 percent.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nImport Licensing\nApproximately three percent of imported goods, including agricultural products, automobiles, and textiles,\nrequire an import license issued by the Tunisian Ministry of Trade and Export Development. Tunisia also\nimposes certain quotas, especially for imported consumer goods that compete with local products.\n344 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS", "344 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nImporters of these goods must request an allotment from the Tunisian Government to receive an import\nlicense. The licenses are typically valid for 12 months after issuance by the Ministry of Trade and Export\nDevelopment.\nTunisia maintains a control system on imports of consumer goods, under which the importer must provide\nseveral documents in order to acquire an import license. The required documents include an invoice from\nthe exporting factory, a certificate from an official authority in the exporter\u2019s country attesting to the\nfactory\u2019s legal status, proof of product trademark, and documents affirming the product\u2019s safety and quality.\nThe list of controlled products includes fragrances, cosmetics, underwear, shoes, household appliances,\nvegetables and fruits, spices, flour, chocolate, and non-alcoholic drinks. Imports of raw materials; semi-\nfinished products, and equipment and spare parts for industries, services, and handicrafts are exempted.", "Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation\nCustoms processing remains cumbersome and, for the most part, reliant on paper documents, despite some\nsteps to digitize certain procedures. Inconsistent application of customs processes within the Tunisian\nCustoms Administration can be a significant obstacle for importers. Although Tunisia expanded its\nsimplified customs clearance process for authorized operators to 152 companies in 2023, risk management\nand other targets are primarily conducted manually by reviewing large volumes of entry documents in paper\nform.\nTunisia notified the latest update to its customs valuation legislation to the WTO in May 2011 but has not\nyet responded to the WTO Checklist of Issues describing how the Customs Valuation Agreement is being\nimplemented.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\nTunisia has made some progress with respect to intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement. The", "country acceded to the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty in\nMarch 2023. However, the presence of and trade in counterfeit and pirated goods, including illicit Internet\nProtocol Television content, remain a concern. Stakeholders have expressed concerns about the lack of an\neffective system for protecting against the unfair commercial use, as well as unauthorized disclosure of\nundisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The\nUnited States will continue to engage with Tunisia to improve IP protection and enforcement in the region.\nELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS\nThe Tunisian dinar is convertible for a limited number of current account transactions. This limits\nTunisians\u2019 ability to purchase goods and services online or receive payments from foreign digital firms.\nIndividual users of \u201cDigital Technology Charge Cards\u201d (the government-approved method for certain firms", "and entities to make purchases of foreign goods and services online) are limited to the equivalent of 1,000\ndinars (approximately $322) per individual in annual purchases; 10,000 dinars (approximately $3,225) per\ncompany; and 100,000 dinars (approximately $32,260) per start-up. Because these relatively low\nthresholds are fixed in dinars, the actual value of the allotments is impacted by currency fluctuations.\nINVESTMENT BARRIERS\nEntering Tunisia\u2019s domestic market, particularly the services sector, remains difficult for foreign investors.\nForeign ownership is limited to 49 percent in most non-industrial sectors, and the process of investing is\nparticularly challenging in areas in which there are no public tenders. Tunisia\u2019s 2016 Investment Law,\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 345\nimplemented through Decree No. 417 (2018), establishes a negative list of sectors for which foreign\ninvestment requires government authorization, including in natural resources; construction materials;", "transportation; banking, finance, and insurance; health; education; and telecommunications. U.S. investors\nin Tunisia frequently raise concerns about delays in obtaining authorizations, lack of transparency regarding\nrules and fees, unfair competition resulting from preferential treatment of state-owned enterprises, and\nbureaucratic complications in the process of registering a business. Foreign investors may not directly own\nagricultural land, though 100 percent foreign ownership of businesses in the agricultural sector is allowed.\nSUBSIDIES\nSubsidies and Domestic Support\nIn 2021, Tunisia notified the WTO Committee on Agriculture that in calendar years 2016 through 2019, it\nprovided no export subsidies subject to reduction commitments, with the exception of those offered under\nArticle 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture. Tunisia has not submitted domestic support notifications for", "more recent years since notifying the WTO in 2021. It has also not provided responses to questions raised\nby the United States and other Members regarding concerns it may be under-notifying its actual levels of\nits agricultural domestic support and export subsidy outlays.\nOTHER BARRIERS\nForeign Exchange\nTunisian law prohibits the export of foreign currency from Tunisia for import payments until the importer\u2019s\nbank receives documents confirming the shipment of merchandise from the country of origin. These\nrequirements remain a source of confusion and difficulty for some U.S. companies.\nCentralized Control of Imported Pharmaceuticals\nThe Tunisian Central Pharmacy maintains a monopoly on pharmaceutical imports.

The tariff on unalloyed hot-rolled sheet increased to 15 percent, and the tariff on alloyed hot-\nrolled sheet increased to 13 percent. The tariff on plate products increased from 9 percent, 10 percent, and\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 347\n15 percent, respectively, to between 15 percent to 20 percent. The tariff on unalloyed cold-rolled sheet\nincreased to 17 percent.\nIn June 2018, T\u00fcrkiye imposed additional duties on multiple U.S. exports in retaliation for the March 2018\ndecision of the United States to impose tariffs on imports of Turkish steel and aluminum articles under\nSection 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. The retaliatory duties were levied on select", "goods of U.S. origin under 22 four- or six-digit Harmonized System headings or subheadings covering 479\nproducts, including an additional 35 percent tariff on passenger cars, a 40 percent tariff on distilled spirits,\na 30 percent tariff on skin care and make-up materials, a 20 percent tariff on rice, a 15 percent tariff on\nwood products, and a 5 percent tariff on certain nuts. Following the August 2018 increase in U.S. duties\non steel products from T\u00fcrkiye, T\u00fcrkiye increased the level of additional duties on U.S. products. In May\n2019, after the United States reduced its duties on steel products from T\u00fcrkiye to the levels in effect prior\nto August 2018, T\u00fcrkiye reduced the level of additional duties on U.S. products to the rates in effect prior\nto August 2018. In December 2023, a WTO panel found that T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s retaliatory duties breached WTO\nrules and that the U.S. Section 232 measures were taken pursuant to the essential security exception under", "the GATT 1994. On January 26, 2024, T\u00fcrkiye appealed the panel report. As of December 31, 2024, no\ndivision of the Appellate Body could be established to hear the appeal. T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s additional duties remain\nin effect.\nT\u00fcrkiye continues to maintain high tariff rates on many imported food and agricultural products, though\nthe customs union with the EU and various free-trade agreements provide duty-free access for many of\nT\u00fcrkiye\u2019s largest trading partners. Agricultural trade is subject to tariff quotas, and certain agricultural\ngoods remain protected by steep tariffs. The average tariff on fresh fruit imports is 39.3 percent, with a\nmaximum WTO bound duty of 146 percent. Tariffs on imported chicken and chicken products are 65\npercent and 121 percent, respectively. However, since late 2020, T\u00fcrkiye has eliminated high tariffs on\ncertain agricultural bulk commodities such as wheat, corn, barley and sunflower seed oil in order to address", "major food inflation and commodity cost increases. In addition, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s investment incentive programs\nprovide for duty and tax concessions on imports commonly used by exporters. A \u201csuspension list\u201d enables\nmanufacturers to import certain raw materials and intermediary inputs at low or duty-exempt rates.\nAs with other agricultural products, the government intervenes in the market for sunflower seeds and\nderivative products to stabilize domestic supplies and prices. These interventions typically come as changes\nto tariffs or the introduction of tariff quotas. In general, the government aims to keeps tariffs high for these\nproducts during the harvest season to protect domestic farmers. Depending on the market situation, the\ngovernment may decide to temporarily relax import duties after the harvest. For example, in August 2024,\nby way of Presidential Decree, T\u00fcrkiye announced a lower-duty quota of 1.0 metric tons (MT) for sunflower", "seed or sunflower oil equivalent between January and April of 2025. The within quota import tariff is 8\npercent for sunflower seed and 20 percent for sunflower oil, while the MFN rates are 27 percent and 36\npercent, respectively.\nIn November 2023, T\u00fcrkiye increased tariffs for walnuts and almonds from all origins to 15 percent. This\ntariff is in addition to the 10 percent retaliatory tariff on U.S.-originated walnuts and almonds. The\n\u201cAdditional Financial Liability\u201d (AFL), an additional tax paid by the importer, also increased for multiple\nproducts on November 1, 2023. The AFL for in-shell walnuts increased to $416 per MT; for shelled walnuts\nthe AFL increased to $1,099 per MT; for in-shell almonds the AFL increased to $580 per MT; and the AFL\nfor shelled almonds increased to $942 per MT. T\u00fcrkiye has insisted that the AFL is not a separate charge,\nbut rather part of the MFN applied tariff rate. The United States continues to engage on this issue to", "understand the administration of the tariff for applicable agricultural products. U.S. stakeholders remain\nconcerned about the complex and non-transparent structure of the AFL and the general level of duty\nimposed by T\u00fcrkiye, reducing predictability and impeding trade.\n348 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\nIn May 2023, the Turkish Government implemented a 130 percent tariff on grains aimed at protecting the\nlocal agricultural industry. The tariff on chickpeas and lentils increased to 19.3 percent in July 2023, and\nthe tariff on milled rice increased to 45 percent in September 2023. These tariffs on staple commodities\nhave helped maintain the high domestic cost of food products and persistently high food inflation in\nT\u00fcrkiye.\nTaxes\nT\u00fcrkiye imposes a value-added tax (VAT) on most imported and domestic goods and services. The\nimporter is responsible for paying the VAT. T\u00fcrkiye calculates its VAT on a cost insurance freight (CIF)", "basis plus duty rate and any other applicable charges levied before the goods clear customs. VAT for most\nagricultural products ranges from 1 percent to 10 percent but may be as high as 20 percent for certain\nprocessed products.

Together, VAT and the\nOTV provide over half of the government\u2019s revenue. In principle, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s VAT and OTV make no\ndistinction between imported and domestically produced goods. However, the OTV on alcoholic beverages", "varies considerably depending on the type of product, and T\u00fcrkiye taxes all alcohol at an extremely high\nrate, with regular review for possible increases every six months. Overall, the tax system has the potential\nto favor the consumption of some products relative to others. Other products impacted by the OTV include\npetroleum products, motor vehicles, aircraft, vessels, and durable consumer goods.\nT\u00fcrkiye imposed new OTV rates on electric vehicles (EVs) on November 18, 2023. As with the OTV rates\nfor internal combustion vehicles, the tax rate is determined through a combination of the vehicle\u2019s engine\nsize and sale price. EVs with engine power below 160 kilowatts (kW) face a 10 percent OTV rate if their\nsale price is less than 1,450,000 Turkish lira (TL) (approximately $44,073), and 40 percent if their sale\nprice exceeds 1,450,000 TL.

EVs with engine power above 160 kW face a 50 percent OTV rate if their\nsale price is below 1,350,000 TL (approximately $41,033) and a 60 percent OTV rate if their sales price\nexceeds 1,350,000 TL (approximately $41,033). T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s domestically produced TOGG is one of the few\nEVs that would qualify for the lowest tax threshold. Published on July 26, 2024, a reduction was introduced\nfor plug-in hybrid cars. The changes in OTV affected vehicles in the 87.03 passenger category. Rates were\nset as follows: engine volume less than 1600 cm\u00b3 and OTV base less than 1,350,000 TL, OTV rate reduced\nfrom 45 percent to 30 percent; engine volume less 1600 cm\u00b3 and OTV base more than 1,350,000 TL, OTV\nrate was 60 percent; engine volume 1600-1800 cm\u00b3 and OTV base less than 1,350,000 TL, OTV rate\nreduced from 80 percent to 70 percent.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nImports are subject to certain border measures in T\u00fcrkiye, including outright prohibitions, licensing,", "controls, and restrictions. Several categories of goods require import licenses subject to change based on\nmarket conditions.\nImport Bans\nSince 2015, T\u00fcrkiye has banned the importation of nearly all refurbished parts, which affects products in\nseveral sectors, including computer equipment and medical devices. T\u00fcrkiye also requires that construction\nequipment, tractors, and agricultural equipment be imported during the year in which individual units are\nFOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 349\nmanufactured, effectively limiting the volume of U.S. exports of such equipment to T\u00fcrkiye, given the long\nlead times associated with these types of orders.\nT\u00fcrkiye stopped all exports to and imports from Israel as of May 2, 2024, citing \u201cworsening humanitarian\ntragedy\u201d in the Palestinian territories.

It also liberalized exports of milling wheat, durum\nwheat, and barley. However, in October 2024, the Turkish Government partially lifted the ban on wheat\nimports, allowing industry to source up to 15 percent of their wheat externally, with the remaining 85\npercent required to be sourced from the Turkish Grain Board (TMO). As of December 31, 2024, T\u00fcrkiye\nhad not provided additional information as to when it intends to lift the ban.\nImport Licensing\nT\u00fcrkiye requires import licenses for some agricultural products and for various products that need after-\nsales service, such as photocopiers, advanced data processing equipment, and diesel generators. U.S. firms\ncomplain that a lack of transparency in T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s import licensing system results in costly delays and", "demurrage charges.\nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation\nCompanies indicate that Turkish documentation requirements for many imports are onerous, inconsistent,\nand non-transparent, often resulting in delayed shipments at Turkish ports. U.S. exporters of certain\nindustrial goods and food products such as rice, dried beans, pulses, sunflower seeds, wheat, and walnuts,\nhave reported concerns regarding decisions by Turkish customs authorities on the valuation of selected\nproducts. Further, the Ministry of Trade periodically requires tracking and monitoring of certain imports,\nwhich includes an onerous registration process that must be completed annually, with limited guidance for\nexporters throughout the registration process. The Ministry of Trade\u2019s mandatory foreign exporter\nregistration process covers 31 agricultural commodities including almonds, walnuts, peanuts, peanut butter,\ntea, garlic, bananas, fresh peppers, flaxseed, rapeseed, and sunflower seed products.", "tea, garlic, bananas, fresh peppers, flaxseed, rapeseed, and sunflower seed products.\nTECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND\nPHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS\nTechnical Barriers to Trade\nFood and Feed Products \u2013 Traceability Requirements\nT\u00fcrkiye\u2019s 2010 Biosafety Law mandates traceability procedures for movement of animal feed products\nproduced using agricultural biotechnology, including a requirement that each supply-chain entity maintains\ntraceability records for 20 years.

The amended measure requires that Turkish authorities\nthemselves perform the inspections, rather than the previous practice of allowing inspections by authorities\nfrom the exporting country, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services or the European Medicines Agency, and has led to severe delays in obtaining\nGMP certifications for many pharmaceutical products. An MOH inspection backlog has prolonged the\nalready lengthy processes for granting final approvals for pharmaceutical products to be sold on the Turkish\nmarket.\nSince 2016, following repeated U.S. requests to T\u00fcrkiye that it accelerate approvals, the MOH has\nauthorized parallel (rather than sequential) submissions of GMP inspection and marketing approval\napplications for MOH-designated \u201cPriority One\u201d (i.e., highly innovative and/or lifesaving) pharmaceutical", "products imported from U.S. and EU firms. While a positive step, as of December 31, 2024, the MOH had\nnot uniformly applied this approach to all pharmaceutical product applications.

T\u00fcrkiye\nconsiders the white tip nematode to be a quarantine pest, even though it is widespread in T\u00fcrkiye. Due to\nthe risk of nematode detection upon arrival and T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s rejection of any available post-entry mitigation,\nsouthern U.S. rice exporters have stopped shipping to T\u00fcrkiye.

Additionally, the transit of poultry from HPAI-affected U.S.\nstates is banned unless the product is heat treated. As T\u00fcrkiye had been an important transit point for U.S.\npoultry shipped to the broader Middle East region, this policy has inhibited U.S. exports of animals and\nanimal products.

Nevertheless, T\u00fcrkiye maintains its ban, seemingly without a scientific basis\nor risk-based rationale. The U.S. Government continues to engage with the Ministry of Agriculture and\nForestry on this issue and has offered several options to ensure exports to T\u00fcrkiye are free from the health-\nrelated challenges.

U.S. pharmaceutical companies have raised concerns that\nthey are unable to market next-generation drugs in T\u00fcrkiye due to the government\u2019s maintenance of an\nartificially low official exchange rate for reimbursement for pharmaceutical products.\nThe Turkish Government maintains two lists totaling approximately 200 pharmaceuticals for which\ngovernment reimbursement is denied unless the products are manufactured in T\u00fcrkiye.

Ukraine\u2019s average MFN applied tariff rate was 9.1 percent for agricultural products and 3.6\npercent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available).

Ukraine employs an automated VAT refund system, but the\nefficacy of that system has been inconsistent, and U.S. companies continue to report that the State Tax\nService delays or rejects VAT refunds. In addition, the State Tax Service continues to request original\ndocuments confirming business transactions within very short deadlines. Companies also report requests\nfor documentation that go beyond what is required by law. The United States has raised concerns about\nsuch delays and requests.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation", "such delays and requests.\nNon-Tariff Barriers\nCustoms Barriers and Trade Facilitation\nWhile Ukraine\u2019s MFN applied tariff rates are relatively low, U.S. businesses have raised concerns that\nUkraine\u2019s State Customs Service (SCS) assigns higher and seemingly inconsistent customs values to\nimports than are reflected in the transaction price as provided in the import documentation. Such practices\nmay raise concerns under the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation and appear contrary to the Ukrainian\nlaw that implements the agreement for determining customs value. Furthermore, it appears that Ukraine\u2019s\nSCS uses its internal valuation database as a mechanism to establish the minimum values of the goods,\nrather than for risk analysis purposes only. Specifically, if there is a slight decrease in the invoice value (as\ncompared to historical prices), or if the declared value is lower than the \u201crisk indicators\u201d (which are not\n358 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS", "358 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS\npublicly available), these circumstances may result in an increased customs value determination for the\ngoods. U.S. businesses also report that the SCS has been sending goods for laboratory tests or additional\nrisk audits more frequently, delaying shipments and raising costs. The United States has frequently raised\nconcerns about these practices with the SCS. On October 17, 2024, Ukraine enacted amendments to the\ncustoms code (Law 3977-IX) that will strengthen integrity measures with SCS. These amendments have\nthe potential to lower operational costs, accelerate processing, and make customs procedures more\npredictable for companies transporting products into and out of Ukraine.\nOther Market Access Barriers\nImporters of U.S. products have complained about inspection officials at ports of entry taking larger\nnumbers of samples than needed for laboratory testing due to a faulty and arbitrary definition of \u201cuniform", "allotment\u201d (i.e., batches identified for sampling). Sampling and testing, particularly of expensive products,\nsuch as fish roe, fish, or chilled meat, and the associated testing fees, poses a significant burden on\nimporters. In 2018, Ukraine adopted legislation establishing the main principles for a governmental food\nand feed control system, including rules governing sampling at the border. Nevertheless, stakeholders claim\nthat testing pursuant to the 2018 legislation continues to be excessive. The United States has asked that\nUkraine ensure these measures are consistent with Ukraine\u2019s WTO obligations.\nTECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND\nPHYTOSANITARY MEASURES\nTechnical Barriers to Trade\nConformity Assessment Procedures \u2013 European Union Technical Regulations and Regimes\nAs part of its Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), including the provisions to establish\na Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area since being granted candidate status for EU membership in", "a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area since being granted candidate status for EU membership in\nJune 2022 and opening EU accession negotiations on December 14, 2023, Ukraine is moving to\napproximate EU technical regulations and the EU\u2019s regulatory regime (including the EU\u2019s conformity\nassessment procedures). Some U.S. industry stakeholders have expressed concerns that this process may\nlead Ukraine to adopt measures that raise technical barriers to trade. Market access to Ukraine may be\nimpeded if Ukraine follows EU practice by refusing to accept standards other than unique EU regional\nstandards as a basis for technical regulations. (For further information of the EU\u2019s approach to\nstandardization and conformity assessment procedures, see the Technical Barriers to Trade section of the\nEU Chapter of this NTE Report.) The United States continues to press Ukraine to ensure that, as it\napproximates its legislation to that of the EU, it does so in a manner that is consistent with its WTO", "obligations. Further, the U.S. Government has urged Ukraine to make full use of the WTO notification\nprocedure to ensure that new regulations and conformity assessment practices are transparent and comply\nwith Ukraine\u2019s international obligations. Separately, Ukraine has launched a pilot program to create an\nelectronic platform to publicize draft regulatory measures, accept public comments, and provide its\nresponses to those comments.\nSanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers\nImport Certification\nTo enforce import requirements for food products of animal origin, Ukraine maintains requirements for 72\ngeneric veterinary certificates for the relevant products.

Live\nanimals and genetic materials can be exported only from audited facilities or facilitates with a confirmed\nexport history. Therefore, live animals and genetic materials are regulated differently in that the exception\nfor EU-approved facilities does not apply. Ukraine has cited the need to harmonize its legislation with that\nof the EU, as well as its preference to maintain its trading relationship with historical exporters, as the\nrationale for these requirements. However, Ukraine\u2019s procedure for adding \u201chistorical exporters\u201d is lengthy\nand problematic, requiring establishments to collect and confirm data on historical exports between 2013\nand 2018. In order to add a new-to-market establishment to Ukraine\u2019s list, that establishment must undergo", "an audit. Although basic principles of foreign individual audits are published, specific rules and\nrequirements for the procedure are unclear, and the process itself is cost-prohibitive for small and medium-\nsized producers. As a result, some U.S. establishments will be unable to export to Ukraine until they\ncomplete an expensive and time-consuming EU approval process, or the United States undergoes a country-\nwide food safety systems audit. The United States has engaged Ukraine on this topic in various meetings\nand continues to work with Ukraine to resolve this issue.\nFood Safety Standards\nUkraine has adopted food safety requirements that mimic EU standards as it deepens its economic\nrelationship with the EU. These measures were notified to the WTO between 2018 and 2024. U.S.\nexporters (primarily exporters of products of animal origin) are concerned that Ukraine\u2019s adoption of EU", "standards as its national standards, particularly those that are not in line with international standards or\nbased on a risk assessment, could make it significantly more difficult to export certain products to Ukraine.\nMany of these Ukrainian requirements are related to agrochemicals, veterinary drugs, and hygiene\nrequirements, among others. The United States is working with Ukraine to introduce science-based\ninternational practices into Ukraine\u2019s rule-making process. In addition, the United States has encouraged\nUkraine to make full use of the WTO sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) notification procedure to ensure that\nUkraine\u2019s process for adopting new SPS measures is transparent and complies with Ukraine\u2019s international\nobligations.\nU.S. industry has raised concerns about Ukraine\u2019s biotechnology regime, largely due to the fact that\nUkraine\u2019s regulatory system for biotechnology products is still in development.

By law, cultivation of biotechnology products is limited to only registered\nagricultural biotechnology products.

However, Vietnam continues to rely\nheavily on administrative actions and penalties to enforce IP, but these have failed to deter counterfeiting\nand piracy. A few successful efforts by stakeholders to negotiate directly with operators of piracy sites to\nshut down the sites are no substitute for enforcement actions and criminal prosecutions by government\nauthorities.
