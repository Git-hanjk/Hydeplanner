From the very", "beginning, and even more so as it unfolded across the entire continent, the United States was populated\nwith people of immense talent, drive, and grit. In the previous century it saved the entire world, dispatching\nthree rounds of adversaries by winning two world wars and defeating Communism. It put an American on\nthe moon.\nThe United States accomplished those feats because it was a tremendous industrial power fueled by\ninnovation and blessed with abundant agricultural and energy resources. Indeed, the very success of the\nAmerican way of life\u2014its freedom and its prosperity\u2014is supported by two things: a robust middle class\nearning high wages and a strong national defense. These are, in turn, created by a combination of innovation\nthat fuels productivity growth, domestic work and investment in industry, and the day-to-day choices of\nindividual Americans.\nToday, the upward mobility offered by the manufacturing sector is not widely available to the working", "class, much of our industrial might has moved overseas, and innovation has begun to follow. Manufacturing\njobs in the United States declined from 17 million in 1993 to 12 million in 2016.1 Over 100,000 factories\nclosed between 1997 and 2016. 2,3 And the U.S. goods trade deficit has soared to over a trillion dollars.4\nThese trends are the product of a withering, decades-long assault by globalist elites who have pursued\npolicies\u2014including trade policies\u2014with the aim of enriching themselves at the expense of the working\npeople of the United States. As a result, the middle class has atrophied, and our national security is at the\nmercy of fragile international supply chains.\nPresident Trump alone recognized the role that trade policy has played in creating these challenges and how\ntrade policy can fix them. Since he first took the oath of office in 2017, President Trump has reshaped the", "trade policy landscape to prioritize the national interest. He has built a new consensus that tariffs are a\nlegitimate tool of public policy. He has demonstrated the imperative for tough trade enforcement against\ncountries who think they can take advantage of the United States and get away with it. He has shown that\nthe United States has leverage and can negotiate aggressively to open markets for Made in America exports,\nparticularly for agricultural exports. He has proven that a robust and realist trade policy can create jobs,\npromote innovation, strengthen the national defense, raise wages, support farmers, and foster the\nmanufacturing renaissance that many elites long thought was impossible for the United States to achieve.\nToward a Production Economy\nTo reach these objectives, the United States must have an economy focused on production. For much of\nour history, the American way of life was defined by creating, inventing, building, growing, and producing.", "Americans are more than just what they consume. And the United States is more than an economy that\n1 FRED Economic Data, \"All Employees, Manufacturing\" (St. Louis Fed).\n2 U.S. Census Bureau, 1997 SUSB Annual Data Tables by Establishment Industry.\n3 U.S. Census Bureau, 2016 SUSB Annual Data Tables by Establishment Industry.\n4 U.S. Census Bureau - Annual 2024 Press Highlights.\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S 2025 TRADE POLICY AGENDA | 1\nmerely moves money around\u2014it is a nation of intertwined communities, oriented around the production of\nmanufactured goods, agricultural products, services, and knowledge. Ensuring that trade policy favors a\nProduction Economy will help the President Make America Great Again.\nWhy? It\u2019s simple:\nA Production Economy is a high-wage economy. Manufacturing jobs have a wage premium of roughly 10\npercent. However, as the United States deindustrialized, that wage premium declined for manufacturing", "workers in core production jobs.5 Using trade policy to increase the number of manufacturing jobs in our\ncountry \u2013 and the share of manufacturing contributing to gross domestic product \u2013 will help raise wages\nand return our country to one with a more vibrant and secure middle class.\nA Production Economy creates jobs for all. Trade policy does not need to pit workers or sectors against\neach other. This is because manufacturing is a sector known for positive spillovers, including in the service\nsector, that benefit the economy overall. One study found that for every additional manufacturing job\ncreated in a community, 1.6 jobs were created in other sectors.6 And agriculture-related jobs\u2014work that\nproduces the sustenance vital for human life\u2014comprise about 10.4 percent of total U.S. employment.7\nA Production Economy is a boon for innovation. Between 2003 and 2017, research and development", "A Production Economy is a boon for innovation. Between 2003 and 2017, research and development\n(R&D) expenditures in China by U.S. multinationals grew at an average rate of 13.6 percent per year, while\nR&D investment by U.S. multinationals in the United States grew by an average of just 5 percent per year.8\nDeploying trade policy tools to create incentives to reshore manufacturing will reverse this troubling trend\nand promote U.S. technological dominance.\nA Production Economy is a vital component of our national defense. The United States was able to win\nWorld War II because of our industrial might, but our manufacturing base has atrophied. Although the\nUnited States produced less than 14,000 aircraft in the two decades prior to World War II, it produced\n96,000 planes annually by 1944.9 By comparison, today the United States can only produce each month\nabout a third of the 360,000 artillery rounds the military says it needs to deter our adversaries.10 Trade", "policy can help strengthen our defense industrial base.\nChanging this alarming trajectory requires a trade policy that is strategically coordinated to achieve three\nthings: an increase in the manufacturing sector\u2019s share of gross domestic product; an increase in real median\nhousehold income; and a decrease in the size of the trade in goods deficit.\nAn America First Trade Policy\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump signed the Presidential Memorandum \u201cAmerica First Trade Policy\u201d\nlaying out a plan to accomplish the transformational change necessary to reverse our country\u2019s economic\ndecline. The Presidential Memorandum instructs USTR and other agencies to undertake rapid,\nunprecedented work to put America First on trade.\n5 Manufacturing Wage Premiums Have Diverged between Production and Nonproduction Workers (Fed.

By identifying, and acting against, such unfair and non-\nreciprocal practices, the United States can use its leverage to open new markets for U.S. exports and re-\nshore the production that has been lost.\nUSTR has been empowered to chart a new course for any trade agreements to ensure they help raise wages\nand grow our industrial base. USTR will review existing trade agreements to guarantee that those\nagreements operate in the national interest. For instance, third countries should not be permitted to free\nride on our trade agreements with other trading partners. Alongside this review, USTR will commence the", "statutorily required public consultation process of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)\nin order to \u201cassess the impact of the USMCA on American workers, farmers, ranchers, service providers,\nand other businesses\u201d in preparation for the mandated review of the agreement in July 2026. USTR will\nalso identify opportunities for bilateral or sector-specific plurilateral agreements that might be negotiated\nto open new market access for U.S. exports and reorient the trading system to promote U.S.\ncompetitiveness.\nThe Presidential Memorandum also addresses U.S. trade relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China, the\nsingle biggest source of our country\u2019s large and persistent trade deficit and a unique economic challenge.\nIn his first term, President Trump negotiated a historic and enforceable Economic and Trade Agreement\nBetween the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of", "China (also known as the Phase One Agreement). However, there has been no action taken to enforce the\nagreement where China has not lived up to its commitments. USTR will assess China\u2019s compliance with\nthe Phase One Agreement.\nThe Phase One Agreement grew out of USTR\u2019s investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974\ninto China\u2019s acts policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property (IP), and\ninnovation. Yet, technology and IP-intensive sectors are hardly the only ones that are threatened by China\u2019s\nnon-market behavior. USTR will look broadly at the bilateral relationship to identify, and respond to,\nadditional unfair practices.\nPresident Trump\u2019s interest in addressing challenges in the relationship with China complements significant\ninterest by the U.S. Congress on the topic. Pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum, USTR will assess\nthe recent legislative proposals related to China\u2019s Permanent Normal Trade Relation (PNTR) status and", "\u201cmake recommendations regarding any proposed changes to such legislative proposals.\u201d\nTaken together, these workstreams signal a national commitment to continuing the America First approach\nto trade developed in President Trump\u2019s first term of office. By taking a strategic, yet vigorous, approach,\nthe United States can finally address the structural challenges distorting the global trading system in ways\nthat undermine U.S. competitiveness and course-correct for the short-sighted trade policy mistakes of the\npast.\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S 2025 TRADE POLICY AGENDA | 3\nBuilding on Past Success\nTo summarize: over the last several decades, the United States gave away its leverage by allowing free\naccess to its valuable market without obtaining fair treatment in return. This cost our country an important\nshare of its industrial base and thereby its middle class and national security. Although many sectors", "benefitted from trade, it was at too high a price\u2014for example, despite its comparative advantage in\nagricultural production, the United States has even incurred a worrying trade deficit in agriculture over the\npast two years.\nGoing forward, the United States will take action to create the leverage needed to rebalance our trading\nrelations and to re-shore production, including, but not limited to, through the use of tariffs. This will raise\nwages and promote a strong national defense.\nImportantly, this America First Trade Policy builds upon President Trump\u2019s accomplishments from his first\nterm.\n\u2022 Though promised by Presidents past, but never accomplished until his first Administration,\nPresident Trump successfully renegotiated NAFTA. Its replacement, the USMCA, contains\nhistoric provisions to re-shore manufacturing (especially in the auto sector, which had been\ndecimated by NAFTA), the strongest labor and environment provisions in any trade agreement,", "decimated by NAFTA), the strongest labor and environment provisions in any trade agreement,\nnew market access for U.S. agricultural products, and high-standard digital trade rules.\n\u2022 Under his leadership, the United States entered into two important agreements with Japan, opening\nnew access for U.S. agricultural products and securing USMCA-style digital trade rules.\n\u2022 The United States also engaged extensively at the WTO, calling attention to and defending U.S.\nrights to take action against non-market policies and practices and reclaiming American\nsovereignty from unaccountable foreign bureaucrats.\n\u2022 The United States responded assertively to China\u2019s unfair trading practices, negotiating the Phase\nOne Agreement to protect U.S. firms against China\u2019s forced technology transfer and IP theft and\nimposing significant bilateral tariffs at the same time.\nThese past successes on trade demonstrates the wisdom and efficacy of President Trump\u2019s America First\napproach.", "approach.\nFirst, the proof is in the pocketbook: In 2001, the year China joined the WTO, real median household\nincome in the United States (measured in 2023 dollars) was $70,020. In 2016, the comparable figure\nwas $73,520\u2014real median household incomes had grown only 5 percent in sixteen years.11 That\u2019s an\nannual average growth rate of 0.3 percent.

As set forth below, persistent\nsystemic failures at the WTO and the intransigence of certain WTO Members have prevented the United\nStates from realizing all of the benefits envisioned at the WTO\u2019s creation. While the United States has\ncontinued to seek constructive ways to engage at the WTO, renewed efforts and new vision from other\nWTO Members are necessary if the WTO is to achieve much-needed reform.\nA. Introduction\nThe World Trade Organization was established by 124 Governments through the Marrakesh Agreement", "The World Trade Organization was established by 124 Governments through the Marrakesh Agreement\nEstablishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement) agreed in April 1994. This agreement\nreplaced an earlier world trade framework under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\nestablished in October 1947.\nAt the time of its establishment, the WTO\u2019s purpose and direction was clear. In the preamble to the\nMarrakesh Declaration in 1994, the Parties expressed their determination to participate \u201cin the world trading\nsystem, based on open, market-oriented policies and the commitments set out in the Uruguay Round\nAgreements and Decisions.1 In the preamble to the WTO Agreement, the Parties expressed their\ndetermination \u201cto develop an integrated, more viable and durable multilateral trading system.\u201d2\nThirty years later, the viability and durability of the WTO is increasingly in question. In fundamental\nrespects, the organization, now comprised of 166 Members, has lost its way.", "respects, the organization, now comprised of 166 Members, has lost its way.\nThis did not occur overnight. It began in large part when China abandoned the market-oriented reform path\non which its 2001 accession was premised and embraced state-led, non-market economic practices. The\nWTO was neither able nor willing to address China\u2019s economic system, which is fundamentally\nincompatible with the open, market-oriented direction envisioned by WTO Members and is contrary to the\noriginal principles of the WTO and its agreements. Faced with unfair and ruinous competition from the\nworld\u2019s largest exporter and a manufacturing superpower, various Members tried unsuccessfully for years\nto find meaningful redress through the WTO\u2019s monitoring, negotiating, and dispute settlement functions.\nWhen these Members were then compelled to take action to protect their industries and workers from\nChina\u2019s unfair practices, China accused them of undermining the trading system and turned the WTO\u2019s", "China\u2019s unfair practices, China accused them of undermining the trading system and turned the WTO\u2019s\nprocesses and its own economic leverage against them.\nChina\u2019s non-market economy is not the only factor in the WTO losing its way. The WTO is also mired in\na development agenda that has made it nearly impossible to reach meaningful outcomes through multilateral\nnegotiations at the WTO. Concepts like special and differential treatment (SDT) carveouts make a mockery\nof the rules and limit negotiating ambition. Moreover, an activist dispute settlement architecture, replete\nwith erroneous Appellate Body and panel interpretations, degrades national sovereignty. Each\nindividually\u2014let alone together\u2014imposes serious strain on the multilateral system.\n1 Preamble to the Marrakesh Declaration of 15 April 1994.\n2 Preamble to the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization.\nTHE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AT THIRTY AND U.S. INTERESTS | 1", "THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AT THIRTY AND U.S. INTERESTS | 1\nStill, at the time of USTR\u2019s last report on the WTO in early 2020, there were reasons for cautious optimism\non the direction of the WTO. At the Eleventh Ministerial Conference (MC11) in December 2017, Members\nresponded to the growing impasse in the WTO\u2019s negotiating function by launching several Joint Statement\nInitiatives that could lead to negotiations among plurilateral groups of Members. The USTR applauded the\nresult, noting that \u201c[m]any Members recognized that the WTO must pursue a fresh start in key areas so that\nlike-minded WTO Members and their constituents are not held back by the few Members that are not ready\nto act.\u201d3 Meanwhile, deliberations on reform were also showing promise. Driven by the United States, a\nreform agenda targeting institutional problems affecting the WTO\u2019s negotiating arm was taking shape,\nfocused initially on transparency and on differentiating among self-declared developing Members.", "focused initially on transparency and on differentiating among self-declared developing Members.\nHowever, recent developments have dashed that cautious optimism. Plurilateral groups of Members have\nadvanced and concluded several negotiations, as envisioned in 2017, but a small subset of Members refuses\nto allow the parties to incorporate these agreements into the WTO\u2019s legal architecture. Blocking these\noutcomes from taking effect signals that while there may be a future for plurilateral negotiations to address\ntoday\u2019s trade challenges, it is not at the WTO. The reform agenda has also collapsed. Serious efforts aimed\nat improving the WTO\u2019s negotiating arm have been replaced by an unambitious focus on improving a few\ncommittee procedures\u2014a lowest-common-denominator effort that was given the fittingly vacuous slogan\n\u201creform by doing.\u201d Further, waiving intellectual property rights under the TRIPS Agreement for COVID-", "19 vaccines, as well as the conclusion of a weak agreement on fisheries subsidies, show that rather than\nboldly tackling global challenges the WTO is prisoner to its lowest-common-denominator.\nThis report describes several of the most serious challenges facing the United States at the WTO. It\nconcludes with a reflection on these challenges and a look ahead to the future.\nB. The WTO Has Been Unable to Reduce Disparities and Imbalances\nAs specified in the WTO\u2019s founding documents and demonstrated by dozens of Accession Protocols, the\nWTO is designed to be an organization of Members committed to market-oriented policies and reciprocal\narrangements to reduce trade barriers, predicated on free and fair competition in global markets.\nHowever, since the WTO was established in 1995, the WTO has not concluded a single multilateral\nagreement that liberalizes market access. The root cause of the failure lies primarily with institutional", "shortcomings. For example, the most serious effort by Members to negotiate non-agricultural market access\ncollapsed in 2008, principally because the advanced self-declared developing Members used their status to\nclaim a right to SDT and deflect pressure to make meaningful offers, thereby depriving the talks of the\nambition needed for a successful outcome. Another significant\u2014though largely unspoken\u2014contributor to\nthe failure was that Members already understood that China\u2019s non-market economy had created an unlevel\nplaying field. Gains from liberalization would be captured by China, and not through fair competition and\nmarket-oriented policies. By 2008, Members were well aware of the \u201cChina Shock\u201d that had decimated\nU.S. industries and workers. If the United States was struggling to protect itself from China\u2019s deepening\nembrace of state-led, mercantilist practices, Members across the development spectrum could rationally", "conclude that it would be unwise to lower tariffs and other barriers.\nOne result of this negotiating failure is many trading powers continue to have very high bound tariff rates,\nfar in excess of the rates applied by the United States or to which the United States is bound. As of 2023,\nthe United States\u2019 average bound tariff rate was 3.4 percent, and its applied most-favored-nation rate (MFN)\nrate was 3.3 percent. In comparison, Brazil\u2019s average bound tariff rate was 31.4 percent, and its applied\nMFN rate was 11.2 percent. India\u2019s average bound and applied MFN tariff rates were 50.8 percent and\n3 \u201cUSTR Robert Lighthizer Statement on the Conclusion of the WTO Ministerial Conference\u201d (December 14, 2017).\n2 | THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AT THIRTY AND U.S. INTERESTS\n17.0 percent, respectively, with only 74 percent of its tariff lines bound. Korea\u2019s average bound and applied\nMFN tariff rates were 17.0 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively.", "MFN tariff rates were 17.0 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively.\nUnder current WTO rules, Members\u2019 bound rates are locked in place with no sunset clause or meaningful\nmechanism to allow the United States and other Members to address disparities that were once envisaged\nas temporary and negotiated in an era when economic and geopolitical realities were very different. It is\nunreasonable to expect that Members will tolerate being locked into these nonreciprocal rates in perpetuity.\nFor the trading system to be durable, commitments on tariffs must keep pace with reality.\nC. The WTO Has Been Unable to Address Non-Market Policies and Practices\nThe political, economic, and trade landscape in 2025 differs greatly from the world as it existed in 1994.\nAt that time, and across the world, there was hope that nations would coalesce around a model of open\nsocieties, free markets, and democratic values. Further, this great convergence would usher in an era of", "peace, safeguarded by deepening economic interdependency, and diminish the role of geopolitics in\ninternational economic relations. This optimism prevailed in Washington and other capitals long after\nwarning signs emerged that many nations were not interested in that model or that outcome.\nThirty years later, Members are grappling with a more challenging era marked by growing divergence. The\nUnited States has been treated unfairly by trading partners for many years, and our workers and industries\nbear the brunt of unfair practices and limited access to foreign markets. The WTO is poorly suited to the\nchallenges of this era, with no better example of this failing than the inability of the WTO\u2019s monitoring,\ndispute settlement, and multilateral negotiating functions to address the challenges posed by China\u2019s non-\nmarket economy.\nChina\u2019s well-chronicled and endemic lack of transparency has long frustrated Members\u2019 attempts to", "China\u2019s well-chronicled and endemic lack of transparency has long frustrated Members\u2019 attempts to\nunderstand China\u2019s trade-distorting non-market policies and practices and monitor their compliance with\nWTO rules and principles. Numerous times, the United States has been compelled to counter-notify\nChinese subsidy programs and state trading enterprises to provide a bare minimum of transparency. But\nthese were temporary band-aids. We must face a stubborn fact\u2014years of careful monitoring work in the\nWTO\u2019s committee system has had no discernible impact on China\u2019s transparency and, more importantly,\nits pervasive use of non-market policies and practices.\nNot only has the dispute settlement system failed to adequately redress violations, but it has also\nundermined Members\u2019 ability to address the harms from China\u2019s non-market economy. A WTO dispute\ntakes years to wind through the system, and even if a specific Chinese measure is found to be non-compliant,", "severe and irreversible harm was suffered long ago when jobs dried up, factories shuttered, and\ncommunities suffered in real time. Despite prosecuting dozens of WTO disputes against China, the United\nStates has realized little economic benefit from these successful disputes \u2013 China\u2019s non-market policies\ncontinue unabated. Furthermore, the WTO\u2019s Appellate Body actively harmed Members\u2019 ability to counter\nChina\u2019s non-market economic distortions, including pervasive market-distorting subsidies, and to provide\nrelief from unfairly traded imports.\nSome WTO Members naively cling to hopes that China\u2019s non-market policies and practices can be\naddressed through multilateral rulemaking. But hope is not a strategy. Multilateral negotiations at the\nWTO require consensus, and so any one Member opposed to reform has the power to prevent it. After two\ndecades of experience, we have no faith that China would comply with the fundamental rules changes", "decades of experience, we have no faith that China would comply with the fundamental rules changes\nnecessary to discipline its economy, even if it were somehow to agree to them.\nTHE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AT THIRTY AND U.S. INTERESTS | 3\nD. The WTO Has Been Unable to Adhere to and Enforce Agreed Rules\nThe Uruguay Round Agreements Act Statement of Administrative Action makes clear that the United States\nis a sovereign country and that when negotiating trade policy, U.S. officials are responsible to the American\npeople. But the WTO\u2019s Appellate Body and WTO panels have diverged from this understanding and\nattempted to impose limits on U.S. policymaking beyond the rules agreed to by the United States.4\nArticle 3.2 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding plainly states, \u201cRecommendations and rulings\nof the Dispute Settlement Body cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in the covered", "agreements.\u201d5 In other words, the dispute settlement process was never intended to make new rules for\nWTO Members. It was instead designed to help Members resolve specific disputes among themselves.\nThese limitations remain vital to U.S. sovereignty because they ensure the United States does not become\nsubject to rules that Congress has not approved.\nOver the past quarter century, the United States has become the chief target of litigation at the WTO, and\nit has lost the overwhelming majority of cases brought against it. The WTO has effectively treated the\nworld\u2019s freest and most open economy \u2013 with an enormous and growing trade deficit \u2013 as the world\u2019s\ngreatest trade outlaw. In so doing, the WTO\u2019s Appellate Body and panels have time and again created new\nobligations from whole cloth. For example:\n\u2022 WTO panels have repeatedly interpreted WTO rules to find that the WTO has the authority to pass", "\u2022 WTO panels have repeatedly interpreted WTO rules to find that the WTO has the authority to pass\njudgment on actions determined by the United States to be in its essential security interests.\n\u2022 A WTO panel has faulted the United States for using tariffs to defend its economy from China\u2019s\nharmful forced technology transfer practices, including widespread state-supported cyber theft and\nindustrial espionage, and refused even to examine the extensive evidence and findings by the\nUnited States \u2013 effectively misreading the WTO Agreement and allowing it to serve as a shield for\nChina\u2019s unfair, non-market policies.\n\u2022 The Appellate Body has restricted the U.S. ability to pursue legitimate policy objectives by\nintroducing requirements not found in the text of the national treatment provision of the GATT\n1994 or the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.\n\u2022 The Appellate Body has attacked U.S. countervailing duty laws, making it more difficult to remedy", "\u2022 The Appellate Body has attacked U.S. countervailing duty laws, making it more difficult to remedy\nthe market-distorting subsidies of China and other trading partners.\n\u2022 The Appellate Body has created requirements that undermine the ability to calculate accurate\nantidumping margins and to provide relief to U.S. workers and businesses from dumped imports.\n\u2022 The Appellate Body has interpreted WTO rules in a manner that puts the U.S. tax system at an\nunfair and illogical disadvantage compared to that of many trading partners.\n\u2022 The Appellate Body has interpreted the Agreement on Safeguards \u2013 an agreement critical to\naddressing global import surges that can overwhelm a particular industry \u2013 in a manner that\nsignificantly limits the ability of Members to use that vital provision.\n\u2022 The Appellate Body has interfered with the appropriations process by limiting Congress\u2019s ability\nto spend money collected through antidumping and countervailing duties.", "to spend money collected through antidumping and countervailing duties.\n4 U.S. Trade Representative Report on the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (February 2020).\n5 Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes.\n4 | THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AT THIRTY AND U.S. INTERESTS\nIt would be contrary to U.S. interests to support a dispute settlement system that adopts these and other\ninterpretations that depart from the plain text as agreed to by the United States. These interpretations of the\nAppellate Body and WTO panels facilitate efforts by some WTO Members to achieve more advantageous\noutcomes through litigation than could be achieved through negotiation. The consequences of this\nstrategy\u2014enabled by the judicial activism of WTO adjudicators \u2013 are tangible: they represent an effort to\nprevent the United States from taking action to protect its essential security interests, address unfair trade", "practices that hurt U.S. workers, and pursue other legitimate policy objectives. In this sense, they also usurp\nthe U.S. Government\u2019s accountability to those who are truly sovereign\u2014the American people.\nThese actions are illustrative of a tendency by the Appellate Body, in particular, to both institute substantive\nand procedural rules to which WTO Members have not agreed and to flout clearly written existing\nprocedural rules. This has led to a significant decline in trust in the Appellate Body, which opened the\nentire dispute settlement system to serious vulnerabilities. The WTO simply cannot claim to stand for a\nrules-based trading system if its own institutions fail to follow clear and explicit rules. Actions by the\nAppellate Body or dispute panels that were contrary to or beyond the agreed-upon rules undermined the\nlegitimacy of the dispute resolution system while also undermining the WTO\u2019s role as a negotiation forum.", "For many years, U.S. Administrations under both parties have warned trading partners of the harm resulting\nfrom the WTO dispute settlement system\u2019s activism. Without the consent of WTO Members, including the\nUnited States, the Appellate Body and panels simply cannot be allowed to unilaterally amend substantive\nWTO rules through erroneous interpretations and undermine our sovereignty.\nFundamental reform of WTO dispute settlement is needed to maintain U.S. participation. The United States\nrecognizes the value of a mechanism to assist Members in the resolution of their trade disputes and has\ninvested considerable effort over a span of years to identify appropriate reforms with WTO Members.\nDespite this engagement, WTO Members continue to have vastly different perspectives on the role of WTO\ndispute settlement in today\u2019s world and the reforms that are needed. The United States will reflect on the", "extent to which it is possible to achieve a reformed WTO dispute settlement system that advances U.S.\ninterests while preserving U.S. sovereignty.\nE. The WTO Has Been Unable to Reform\nThe United States proactively put reform on the WTO\u2019s agenda. Shortly after the Doha Development\nAgenda ended in failure in December 2015, the United States recognized it would be difficult for the\norganization to find a way forward in the near-term without significant changes, and so began to diagnose\ninstitutional problems. Two longstanding problems quickly became clear: Members\u2019 poor record in\nmeeting WTO notification rules, and the inability to differentiate among self-declared developing\nMembers.\nNotification commitments are fundamental elements of many WTO agreements and critical to the proper\nfunctioning of the WTO\u2019s monitoring and negotiating functions.

Recognizing that some Members,\nparticularly least developed countries (LDCs), face capacity constraints with notifications, the proposal\ncreated opportunities for targeted delivery of notification-related technical assistance and capacity building.\nImportantly, the proposal also included administrative measures to hold accountable those Members that\nchronically do not adhere to their notification obligations and have no need of technical assistance. As the\nUnited States explained in the General Council, \u201cWTO Membership is a privilege that also includes\nnotification obligations that all Members agreed to as a condition of Membership.\u201d7", "notification obligations that all Members agreed to as a condition of Membership.\u201d7\nThe United States then consulted with other Members to steadily build support among the Membership.\nAlong the way, we made useful improvements with our growing list of co-sponsors, but we also made a\ndifficult concession, dropping the administrative measures due to a clear lack of support within the\nMembership. The choice was unfortunately clear: take a small step forward that helps Members truly in\nneed but does not increase accountability for those Members that are unwilling to be transparent\u2014or take\nno steps at all. The United States and its co-sponsors\u2014by then totaling more than one-third of the\nMembership\u2014chose the former.\nWhether that choice was sound in hindsight, this limited effort to increase transparency was blocked. When\nthe proposal was tabled in the General Council for decision in 2022, China was joined by many Members", "in raising spurious concerns and questions. China said the proposal did not define \u201ccomplete notification,\u201d\neven though the term is used in many WTO documents, including the first Ministerial Declaration in 1996.8\nOthers took China\u2019s cue and erroneously stated or implied the proposal would impose new burdens; South\nAfrica, for example, said the proposal would create \u201ca new set of far-reaching obligations.\u201d9 The U.S.\nRepresentative closed the discussion by asking Members to simply read the proposal, because there were\nno new rules or obligations.10 However, the writing was on the wall. Even in its least ambitious form, the\nproposal did not come close to achieving consensus.\nCompounding these transparency-related impediments to reform is the WTO\u2019s continued treatment of\nadvanced or wealthy economies self-designating as developing countries.\nDespite significant and sustained development strides made in the years since the WTO\u2019s inception, the", "WTO remains stuck in a binary construct of developed and developing countries that does not reflect the\nrealities of 2025. This framework has allowed some WTO Members to gain unfair advantages at the\nWTO, particularly at the negotiating table, where they seek to perpetuate a system in which all of the\nrules apply to a few (the developed countries), and just some of the rules apply to most \u2013 including\nadvanced, sophisticated, or very wealthy Members.\nSDT status provides several benefits, including generous transition periods, higher tariff bindings, and the\nability to use prohibited subsidies. Under the current system, countries can obtain SDT benefits by merely\nself-declaring as \u201cdeveloping\u201d\u2014regardless of their per capita gross national income, their income\n7 WTO General Council \u201cMinutes of Meeting\u201d, at 81 (Meeting held November 22-23, 2021).\n8 WTO General Council \u201cMinutes of Meeting\u201d, at 68 (Meeting held July 25-26, 2022).", "8 WTO General Council \u201cMinutes of Meeting\u201d, at 68 (Meeting held July 25-26, 2022).\n9 WTO General Council \u201cMinutes of Meeting\u201d, at 71 (Meeting held July 25-26, 2022).\n10 WTO General Council \u201cMinutes of Meeting\u201d, at 78 (Meeting held July 25-26, 2022).\n6 | THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AT THIRTY AND U.S. INTERESTS\nclassification according to the World Bank, their OECD membership or application status, their weight in\nglobal merchandise trade, or any other objective criteria.\nToday, about three-quarters of WTO Members claim developing-country status, arguing they are entitled\nto SDT as a matter of right. Many such designations are entirely unreasonable and are contrary to nearly\nany objective criteria. For example, advanced economies like China, Israel, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and\nT\u00fcrkiye continue to insist they are automatically entitled to SDT. A similar claim is made by some of the\nrichest nations in the world, including Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.", "richest nations in the world, including Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.\nAllowing self-declaration of development status to determine eligibility for SDT damages the negotiating\narm of the WTO. By demanding the same flexibilities as much smaller, poorer Members, export\npowerhouses and wealthy Members create asymmetries that hinder efforts to sustain meaningful outcomes.\nMembers cannot find mutually agreeable trade-offs or build coalitions when significant players use self-\ndeclared development status to avoid making meaningful offers. Basing eligibility for SDT on self-declared\ndevelopment status also dilutes the benefit for those Members that truly are less developed or have specific\nneeds that require flexibility.\nIn an effort to resolve this issue through reform, the United States in early 2019 tabled a proposal in the\nGeneral Council to establish objective criteria to determine eligibility for SDT. If a Member met at least", "one of the criteria, that Member would forego SDT in those current and future negotiations. The criteria\nwere: high income status, according to the World Bank; membership or applicant to the OECD; meeting a\nthreshold share of global merchandise trade; and G20 membership.\nAs the reform conversation continued in Geneva, several Members demonstrated leadership and an interest\nin pursuing meaningful reform. Specifically, Brazil, Singapore, Korea, and Costa Rica announced they\nwould forego SDT in current and future WTO negotiations. But other Members refused to consider that\nstep, despite growing evidence that they are too advanced, sophisticated, or wealthy to warrant SDT.\nAs China approaches the World Bank\u2019s threshold for High Income status, it has begun to indicate it would\nvoluntarily not avail itself of SDT in some\u2014but not all\u2014negotiations. While appearing magnanimous, this\ngambit is a cynical attempt to gain negotiation leverage. If a Member gets to decide when to claim SDT", "and when not to claim SDT, that Member can choose to scuttle any negotiations if the Member does not\nlike where the negotiations have landed by claiming a right to SDT.\nThis issue\u2014and the damage it imposed on the WTO\u2019s multilateral negotiating arm\u2014will not be resolved\nuntil China and other advanced, sophisticated or wealthy Members announce they will forego SDT in all\ncurrent and future WTO negotiations.\nF. The WTO Has Been Unable to Negotiate Meaningful Outcomes\nDespite years or even decades of conversation and debate on the same topics, WTO negotiations frequently\nresult in agreements that do not meaningfully promote U.S. interests, and in some cases actively undermine\nthem.\nThe WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (AFS), adopted at the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) in\nJune 2022, is only the second multilateral agreement reached at the WTO since its inception, following the\nTrade Facilitation Agreement which entered into force in 2017. In the two years since its adoption, the", "AFS has yet to enter into force. As of February 2025, there are 90 instruments of acceptance deposited by\nMembers out of the 111 required (two thirds of the WTO Membership). Historically, fisheries subsidies\nhave been under notified, if at all, and the majority of Members have been non-transparent with respect to\nsuch subsidies. The AFS prohibits fisheries subsidies to: vessels or operators engaged in illegal, unreported,\nTHE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AT THIRTY AND U.S. INTERESTS | 7\nand unregulated (IUU) fishing; fishing or fishing related activities regarding overfished stocks; and fishing\nor fishing related activities on the unregulated high seas. During MC12, negotiators were unable to reach\nconsensus on disciplining certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and\noverfishing (OCOF), and as a result, negotiations on comprehensive disciplines continue. The AFS", "overfishing (OCOF), and as a result, negotiations on comprehensive disciplines continue. The AFS\nincludes a sunset clause such that if negotiations on comprehensive disciplines are not concluded within\nfour years after entry into force of the AFS, the agreement will expire unless otherwise agreed by the\nMembership.\nFollowing a strategic pause, negotiations on the additional OCOF disciplines, including on fisheries\nsubsidies contingent upon fishing outside a Member\u2019s national jurisdiction, have been ongoing since\nJanuary 2023. Members were close to an outcome at the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13) in\nFebruary 2024, but one Member blocked consensus on the text and continued to do so throughout 2024,\nalong with a small group of other Members. The impasse, and subsequent negotiations, has resulted in a\ncontinued watering down of the negotiating text. Developing country WTO Members have continued to", "continued watering down of the negotiating text. Developing country WTO Members have continued to\npress for extensive carve outs from any meaningful discipline on their fisheries subsidies. The lack of\nwillingness of major fishing nations, developing or developed, to take measures to discipline the most\nharmful fisheries subsidies will undoubtedly undermine the effectiveness of the AFS and the ability of\nMembers to reform their fisheries subsidies and fully implement the agreement or any additional\ndisciplines.\nThe WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which\ncame into effect in 1995 as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations creating the WTO, sets minimum\nstandards for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, including in the areas of\ncopyright, trademarks, patents, and undisclosed information. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain", "copyright, trademarks, patents, and undisclosed information. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain\ndeveloping country Members increased their long-standing attacks against the TRIPS Agreement, arguing\nthat some of its commitments regarding intellectual property protections, specifically patent protections for\nCOVID-19 vaccines, were \u201chindering or potentially hindering timely provisioning of affordable medical\nproducts to the patients.\u201d\nOther Members pointed out how robust intellectual property protections were critical to the rapid\ndevelopment of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments and how other factors were the main roadblocks to\naccess to medicines, including inadequate regulatory systems and measures that developing country\nMembers took themselves, such as maintaining high tariffs on pharmaceutical products. They also provided\nnumerous examples of voluntary licensing on mutually agreed terms, including those involving companies", "based in developing country Members, that increased access to vaccines and treatments. However, this did\nnot stop a vocal group of Members from requesting a broad waiver from \u201cthe implementation, application\nand enforcement of Sections 1, 4, 5, and 7 of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement in relation to prevention,\ncontainment or treatment of COVID-19,\u201d which would cover copyright, industrial designs, patents, and\nundisclosed information.11\nAfter nearly two years of debate, WTO Members adopted the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement\nin June 2022, which set forth clarifications and a waiver for eligible WTO Members to authorize the use of\nthe subject matter of a patent required for the production and supply of COVID-19 vaccines. This five-\nyear waiver has not increased access to COVID-19 vaccines but instead may actually negatively impact the\ndevelopment of new treatments and cures for the next pandemic by weakening the standard for intellectual", "property protections and furthering a false narrative about the role of intellectual property and access to\nmedicines.\n11 \"Waiver from Certain provisions of the TRIPS Agreement for the Prevention, Containment and Treatment of COVID-19,\"\n(WTO, Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Oct. 2, 2020)).\n8 | THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AT THIRTY AND U.S. INTERESTS\nG. Conclusion\nThe United States traces our leadership role in the multilateral system back more than seven decades, to the\nsigning of the GATT. During the Uruguay Round, we were a key architect of the WTO, and since 1995,\nthe United States has been deeply engaged in every facet of work in the organization.\nIn its previous five-year report assessing the WTO at 25, USTR called attention to these challenges. In fact,\nall previous Administrations have\u2014on a bipartisan basis, no less\u2014raised these exact concerns. What is", "new is that, despite turning 30 years old, the WTO has not matured. The same problems persist. The same\nbehaviors continue to go uncorrected. The longstanding critique, and raft of proposed solutions, have not\nbeen taken seriously. In fact, the problems have only grown. As the weak Agreement on Fisheries\nSubsidies and the debacle over the TRIPS waiver demonstrate, recent activities at the WTO have\nundermined the interests of members and made a farce of the institution. The United States has tried\u2014and\nwill continue to try\u2014to solve these problems. But patience wears thin.\nIn closing, we must recognize that the WTO that the United States helped create is in key respects not the\nWTO we have today, and the WTO we have today does not further the objectives of the countries that\nfounded it. This is not a sudden development, and the United States has engaged in good faith over a long\nperiod of time to try to find solutions. Going forward, the United States will continue to look for new", "avenues to make the WTO more relevant and viable in light of the realities of today, but it will do so with\nan appreciation that meaningful reform will require participation by other Members, including those that\nhave benefited from the failure of the WTO to fulfill its objectives.\nTHE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AT THIRTY AND U.S. INTERESTS | 9\nTHE 2024 ANNUAL REPORT\nOF THE PRESIDENT\nON THE TRADE AGREEMENTS PROGRAM\nI. PROGRAMS, AGREEMENTS,\nNEGOTIATIONS, AND OTHER INITIATIVES\nA. PREFERENCE PROGRAMS\n1. Generalized System of Preferences\nThe U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461 et seq.) was created by the\nTrade Act of 1974 and promotes sustainable development by providing eligible developing countries with\nduty-free access to the U.S. market for approximately 3,500 non-import sensitive products and an additional\napproximately 1,500 products for least developed beneficiary developing countries (LDBDCs). GSP was", "approximately 1,500 products for least developed beneficiary developing countries (LDBDCs). GSP was\nauthorized initially for a 10-year period, beginning on January 1, 1976. Congress reauthorized the program\n14 times subsequently, most recently in March 2018. That authorization lapsed on December 31, 2020.\nAs a result of the lapse of GSP\u2019s authorization, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR)\ndid not carry out an annual product review to consider the addition or removal of products or waivers to\ncompetitive need limitations in 2024. However, the United States engaged with GSP beneficiaries,\nincluding Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Maldives,\nPacific Islands, Paraguay, the Philippines, Thailand, and Uzbekistan, to help improve utilization of GSP\nbenefits and compliance with GSP eligibility requirements, in preparation for the GSP program\u2019s potential\nreauthorization by the U.S. Congress.", "reauthorization by the U.S. Congress.\nFor further discussion of the GSP program, see Chapters II.F.1 Preference Programs, Monitoring and\nEnforcement and IV.E.2 Labor and Trade Monitoring and Enforcement Activities of Existing Agreements.\n2. African Growth and Opportunity Act\nThe African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (Title I of The Trade and Development Act of 2000,\nP.L. 106-200, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701 et seq.) provides eligible sub-Saharan African countries with duty free\naccess to the U.S. market for certain products. The AGOA requires the President to designate annually\nwhich of the sub-Saharan African countries listed in the Act are eligible to receive AGOA benefits. The\nAGOA Implementation Subcommittee of the Trade Policy Staff Committee examines, through an annual\nreview, whether each country already eligible for AGOA benefits has continued to meet the eligibility\ncriteria and whether circumstances in ineligible countries have improved sufficiently to warrant their", "designation as AGOA beneficiary countries. The AGOA eligibility criteria include establishing or making\ncontinual progress in establishing: (1) a market-based economy; (2) rule of law; (3) poverty-reduction\npolicies; (4) a system to combat corruption and bribery; and (5) protection of internationally recognized\nworker rights. The AGOA also requires that eligible countries do not engage in activities that undermine\nU.S. national security or foreign policy interests or engage in gross violations of internationally recognized\nhuman rights.\nThe annual review takes into account information drawn from U.S. Government agencies, civil society,\nAfrican governments, the private sector, and other interested stakeholders. Through the AGOA eligibility\nreview process, the AGOA Forum, and ongoing dialogue with AGOA partners, the AGOA provides\nincentives to promote economic and political reform as well as trade expansion in AGOA-eligible countries", "in support of broad-based economic development. As a result of the AGOA eligibility review conducted\nduring 2024, 32 sub-Saharan African countries remain eligible for AGOA benefits as of January 1, 2025.\nAdditionally, during 2024, the United States continued to closely monitor Mauritania\u2019s progress in\nI.

This report provided a description of the status of trade and\ninvestment between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa, changes in country eligibility for AGOA", "benefits, an analysis of country compliance with the AGOA eligibility criteria, and an overview of regional\nintegration and U.S. trade capacity building efforts in sub-Saharan Africa.\nFor information on the AGOA Eligibility Review, see Chapter II.F.1 Preference Programs, Monitoring and\nEnforcement.\n2024 African Growth and Opportunity Act Forum\nFrom July 24 through July 26, 2024, the U.S. Trade Representative co-hosted the 21st U.S.-sub-Saharan\nAfrica Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum, also known as the AGOA Forum, in Washington, D.C.\nThe 2024 AGOA Forum convened senior government officials from the United States and 32 AGOA-\neligible countries, representatives of continental and regional economic organizations, and U.S. and African\nrepresentatives from labor organizations, civil society, and the private sector. The 2024 AGOA Forum\nplaced significant emphasis on the future of the AGOA and the importance of improving the AGOA to", "placed significant emphasis on the future of the AGOA and the importance of improving the AGOA to\ndeliver tangible benefits to more working communities. The United States highlighted its commitment to\nthe AGOA program and hosted a number of conversations on a broad range of issues, including using the\nAGOA to drive economic growth for Africans and Americans, as well as further deepening U.S.-Africa\ntrade and economic relations.\nValue of Trade Entering the United States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act\nTotal imports claimed under the AGOA program (including under the U.S. GSP program) in 2024 were\n$8.4 billion, down 13.8 percent from 2023 and down 19.1 percent from 2022. The decrease in exports to\n$8.4 billion in 2024 was due largely to a decrease in exports of petroleum oil ($2.2 billion) in 2024. AGOA\nnon-oil trade increased by 15.1 percent to $6.4 billion in 2023.\nThe top five exports to the United States at the Harmonized System (HS) 6-digit level under the AGOA", "program during 2024 were: passenger motor vehicles, petroleum oils, refined copper cathodes, jewelry,\nand ferrochromium.\nThe top five AGOA users by value in 2023 were: South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Madagascar.\n3. Caribbean Basin Initiative\nSeventeen Caribbean countries and territories are beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI),\nwhich was launched in 1983 through the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (P.L. 98-67),\n19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701 et seq. The CBERA facilitates the development of Caribbean Basin economies by\nproviding beneficiary countries with duty-free access to the U.S. market for most goods. In 2000, the\nUnited States enacted the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) (Title II of the Trade and\nDevelopment Act of 2000, P.L. 106-200), to enhance existing CBERA preferences. The CBTPA\nrecognized the significance of apparel as a component of CBI exports to the United States and expanded", "the degree of preferential treatment applied to U.S. imports of apparel made in the Caribbean Basin region.\n2 | I. PROGRAMS, AGREEMENTS, NEGOTIATIONS, AND OTHER INITIATIVES\nEight of the CBERA beneficiary countries and territories are also beneficiaries under the CBTPA. The\nCBTPA has been renewed by Congress several times since it was enacted, most recently on October 10,\n2020, when the program was extended until September 30, 2030.\nCBI benefits for Haiti were further expanded with the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership\nEncouragement Act of 2006 (HOPE Act) (P.L. 109-432, Div. D, Title V), the HOPE II Act of 2008 (HOPE\nII Act) (P.L. 110-234, Title XV, Subtitle D, Part I), and the Haitian Economic Lift Program Act of 2010\n(HELP Act) (P.L. 111-171), which provided Haiti preferential treatment for its textile and apparel products.\nThe Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (TPEA) (P.L. 114-27) extended trade benefits provided to", "Haiti in the HOPE Act, the HOPE II Act, and the HELP Act until September 30, 2025. The TPEA also\nextended the value-added rule for apparel articles wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti until\nDecember 19, 2025.\nDuring 2024, total imports claimed under the CBI were $1.4 billion and accounted for 12.5 percent of total\nU.S. imports from CBI beneficiary countries.\nFor further discussion of the CBI, see Chapter II.F.1 Preference Programs, Monitoring and Enforcement.\n4. Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity Through Partnership Encouragement\nAct\nThe Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 (HOPE Act) (P.L.\n109-432, Div. D, Title V), the HOPE II Act of 2008 (HOPE II Act) (P.L. 110-234, Title XV, Subtitle D,\nPart I), and the Haitian Economic Lift Program Act of 2010 (HELP Act) (P.L. 111-171) provide duty-free\ntreatment for eligible imports of apparel, select textiles, and certain other goods from Haiti until September", "30, 2025. During 2024, total imports claimed under the HOPE/HELP program were $387 million and\naccounted for 61.3 percent of total U.S. imports from Haiti.\nPursuant to HOPE II requirements, Haitian producers must comply with internationally recognized worker\nrights to be eligible for duty-free treatment under HOPE II. The U.S. Government, in cooperation with the\nInternational Labor Organization, monitors compliance of producers with worker rights and issues an\nannual report on the status of the Technical Assistance Improvement and Compliance Needs Assessment\nand Remediation (TAICNAR) program. (For information on monitoring efforts, see the 2024 USTR\nAnnual Report on the Implementation of the Technical Assistance Improvement and Compliance Needs\nAssessment and Remediation (TAICNAR) Program and Assessment of Producer Eligibility.)\nFor further discussion of HOPE II, see Chapter II.F.1 Preference Programs, Monitoring and Enforcement.\n5. Nepal Trade Preference Program", "5. Nepal Trade Preference Program\nThe Nepal Trade Preference Program (NTPP) (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 4454) was authorized by the Trade Facilitation\nand Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 and provides duty-free treatment for 77 tariff lines from Nepal, which\ninclude certain carpets, headgear, shawls, and scarves through December 31, 2025, when the program\nexpires. During 2024, total imports claimed under the NTPP program were $3.4 million and accounted for\nroughly 2.8 percent of total U.S. imports from Nepal.\nThe NTPP includes statutory criteria necessary to receive the benefits of the preference program, which\ninclude, among other criteria, establishing or making continual progress toward establishing a market-based\neconomy, rule of law, and the protection of internationally recognized worker rights.

TRADE NEGOTIATION INITIATIVES\n1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity\nThe goal of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) is to work with like-minded\npartners to advance cooperation, stability, prosperity, development, and peace within the Indo-Pacific\nregion and provide tangible economic benefits for workers, consumers, and businesses (including micro-,\nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises) across the region.\nIn May 2022, the United States launched IPEF with Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia,", "Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nThe group is pursuing cooperation under four \u201cPillars\u201d: (I) Trade, (II) Supply Chains, (III) Clean Economy,\nand (IV) Fair Economy. In addition to the four Pillars, the IPEF partners negotiated Ministers-level\ncoordinating mechanisms under the Agreement on IPEF to facilitate overarching cooperation. IPEF is\ndesigned to be flexible, and the IPEF partners are not required to participate in all four pillars.\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) leads the Trade Pillar, and the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce leads on the Supply Chains, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy Pillars, while\nco-leading with USTR on anticorruption in the Fair Economy Pillar. Trade Pillar partners are: Australia,\nBrunei Darussalam, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines,", "Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. In addition to the Trade Pillar partners, India also joined negotiations\nfor the Supply Chain, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy Pillars.\nAs of December 31, 2024, negotiations on the Trade Pillar were still ongoing. Through the Trade Pillar\nnegotiations, the United States has been seeking to build high-standard trade commitments and to develop\nnew, creative, and economically meaningful approaches to trade policy in the Indo-Pacific region. USTR\nhad been endeavoring to advance U.S. trade policy goals of resilience and sustainability by negotiating\ncommitments in the following areas: labor, environment, agriculture, transparency and good regulatory\npractices, services domestic regulation, competition and consumer protection policy, customs\nadministration and trade facilitation, digital economy, and technical assistance and economic cooperation.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the IPEF partners had completed negotiation of the three Commerce-led Pillars.", "The IPEF Agreement Relating to Supply Chain Resilience was signed in November 2023 and entered into\nforce on February 24, 2024.

OVERVIEW\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) coordinates the U.S. Government monitoring\nand enforcement of rules and norms that underlie the international trading system and promote fair, market-", "oriented conditions for U.S. workers and businesses. USTR enforces laws that promotes fair and\ncompetitive trade and foreign government compliance with trade agreements to which the United States is\na party, including through the use of dispute settlement procedures and applying the full range of U.S. trade\nlaws. Vigorous monitoring and investigation efforts by USTR and relevant expert agencies, including the\nU.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice, Labor, State, and Treasury, help\nensure that these agreements yield the maximum benefits in terms of ensuring market access for Americans,\nadvancing understanding and respect for international commitments, and creating a fair, competitive, and\nmarket-oriented trading environment.\nEnsuring full implementation of U.S. trade agreements is one of the strategic priorities of the United States.\nUSTR seeks to achieve this goal through a variety of means, including:", "USTR seeks to achieve this goal through a variety of means, including:\n\u2022 Asserting U.S. rights through World Trade Organization (WTO) bodies and committees charged\nwith monitoring implementation and surveillance of agreements and disciplines, and use of dispute\nsettlement as appropriate;\n\u2022 Promoting U.S. interests under free trade agreements (FTAs) through work programs, accelerated\ntariff reductions, and strategic use of dispute settlement mechanisms, including with respect to labor\nand environmental obligations, such as through the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement\n(USMCA) Facility-Specific Rapid-Response Labor Mechanism (for further discussion of the\nRapid-Response Labor Mechanism, see Chapter III.E.2 Labor and Trade, Monitoring and\nEnforcement Activities of Existing Agreements);\n\u2022 Vigorously monitoring and enforcing other bilateral and plurilateral agreements;\n\u2022 Invoking U.S. trade laws to promote compliance, including in conjunction with bilateral,", "\u2022 Invoking U.S. trade laws to promote compliance, including in conjunction with bilateral,\nplurilateral, and WTO mechanisms when appropriate; and\n\u2022 Providing technical assistance to trading partners, especially to developing countries, to ensure that\nkey obligations are implemented on schedule.\nThrough the vigorous application of U.S. trade laws and strategic use of dispute settlement procedures, the\nUnited States helps defend U.S workers, businesses, and farmers against unfair practices; promotes a level\nplaying field through promoting respect for fair, competitive, market-oriented conditions; and opens foreign\nmarkets to U.S. goods and services. For example, USTR\u2019s Office of Monitoring and Enforcement leads\nU.S. efforts to defend U.S. interests through investigations and actions under Section 301, in WTO and\nFTA disputes, and through investigations and actions under the USMCA Rapid Response Labor", "FTA disputes, and through investigations and actions under the USMCA Rapid Response Labor\nMechanism. These enforcement efforts have resulted in major benefits for U.S. workers, businesses, and\nfarmers, as well as workers around the world.\nII. TRADE ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES AND ACTIONS | 37\nFavorable Dispute Resolutions or Settlements\nDispute settlement is one mechanism that the United States may use to secure benefits for U.S. stakeholders.\nWhenever possible, the United States has sought to reach favorable resolutions or settlements that eliminate\nthe foreign breach without having to resort to engaging in prolonged litigation.\nIn 2023, the United States was able to achieve this preferred result in four disputes involving: India\u2019s\nimport restrictions on poultry products; India\u2019s domestic content requirements for participation in solar\npower generation; India\u2019s measures relating to certain export subsidy programs; and India\u2019s imposition of", "additional duties in retaliation for the U.S. Section 232 national security measures on steel and aluminum.\nIn previous years, the United States had already achieved this preferred result in 38 disputes concluded,\ninvolving: Argentina\u2019s protection and enforcement of patents; Australia\u2019s ban on salmon imports;\nBelgium\u2019s duties on rice imports; Brazil\u2019s automotive investment measures; Brazil\u2019s patent law; Canada\u2019s\nadditional duties on certain products; Canada\u2019s antidumping and countervailing duty investigation on corn;\nChina\u2019s value-added tax exemptions for certain domestically produced aircraft; China\u2019s Demonstration\nBase/Common Service Platform export subsidy program; China\u2019s Automobile and Automobile Parts\nExport Bases prohibited subsidy program; China\u2019s value-added tax on integrated circuits; China\u2019s use of\nprohibited subsidies for green technologies; China\u2019s treatment of foreign financial information suppliers;", "China\u2019s subsidies for so-called Famous Brands; China\u2019s support for wind power equipment; Denmark\u2019s\ncivil procedures for IP enforcement; Egypt\u2019s apparel tariffs; the European Union\u2019s (EU) market access for\ngrains; an EU import surcharge on corn gluten feed; the EU\u2019s subsidies to Airbus for large civil aircraft;\nthe EU\u2019s claim of compliance in the dispute involving subsidies to Airbus for large civil aircraft; the EU\u2019s\nadditional duties imposed on a variety of U.S. exports; Greece\u2019s protection of copyrighted motion pictures\nand television programs; Hungary\u2019s agricultural export subsidies; India\u2019s compliance regarding its patent\nprotection; Indonesia\u2019s barriers to the importation of horticultural products (two disputes); Ireland\u2019s\nprotection of copyrights; Japan\u2019s protection of sound recordings; Korea\u2019s shelf life standards for beef and\npork; Mexico\u2019s additional duties on certain products; Mexico\u2019s restrictions on hog imports; Pakistan\u2019s", "protection of patents; the Philippines\u2019 market access for pork and poultry; the Philippines\u2019 automotive\nregime; Portugal\u2019s protection of patents; Romania\u2019s customs valuation regime; Sweden\u2019s enforcement of\nIP rights; and T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s box office taxes on motion pictures.\nLitigation Successes\nWhen U.S. trading partners have not been willing to negotiate settlements, USTR has pursued its offensive\ncases to conclusion. In 2023, the United States prevailed in two disputes involving: China\u2019s imposition of\nadditional duties in retaliation for the U.S. Section 232 national security measures on steel and aluminum;\nand T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s imposition of additional duties in retaliation for the U.S. Section 232 national security\nmeasures on steel and aluminum.\nIn previous years, the United States had prevailed in 47 cases against foreign trade barriers involving:\nArgentina\u2019s import licensing restrictions and other trade-related requirements; Argentina\u2019s tax and duties", "on textiles, apparel, and footwear; Australia\u2019s export subsidies on automotive leather; Canada\u2019s\nadministration of USMCA dairy tariff-rate quotas; Canada\u2019s barriers to the sale and distribution of\nmagazines; Canada\u2019s export subsidies and an import barrier on dairy products; Canada\u2019s law protecting\npatents; China\u2019s provision of agricultural domestic support for grains producers in excess of its commitment\nlevels; China\u2019s administration of its tariff-rate quotas for grains; China\u2019s charges on imported automobile\nparts; China\u2019s measures restricting trading rights and distribution services for certain publications and\naudiovisual entertainment products; China\u2019s enforcement and protection of IP rights; China\u2019s measures\nrelated to the exportation of raw materials; China\u2019s countervailing and antidumping duties on grain oriented\nflat-rolled electrical steel from the United States; China\u2019s claim of compliance in the dispute involving\n38 | II.

China has largely achieved its dominance goals, severely disadvantaging U.S.\ncompanies, workers, and the U.S. economy generally through lessened competition and commercial\nopportunities and through the creation of economic security risks from dependencies and vulnerabilities.\nTop-down industrial planning and targeting is a critical feature of China\u2019s state-led, nonmarket economic\nsystem. China organizes the development of its economy at a high level through broad national-level five-\nyear economic and social development plans. It then employs industry-specific plans that typically align\nchronologically with the national five-year plans. These plans often contain detailed quantitative and\nqualitative targets, including for production, domestic content, and domestic and international market", "shares, and outline the non-market policies and practices China should use to achieve these targets. Market\nshare targets necessitate substitution by Chinese companies at the expense of foreign competitors \u2013 for\nChinese companies to gain market share, they must displace foreign companies in existing markets and take\nnew markets as they develop in the future. China\u2019s industrial targets have become more aggressive and\nsophisticated over the years. China\u2019s plans reveal its targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding\nsectors for dominance.\nChina\u2019s targeting of these sectors for dominance has undercut competition and taken market share with\ndramatic effect: raising China\u2019s shipbuilding market share from less than 5 percent of global tonnage in\n1999, to over 50 percent in 2023; increasing China\u2019s ownership of the commercial world fleet to over 19\npercent as of January 2024; and controlling production of 95 percent of shipping containers and 86 percent", "of the world\u2019s supply of intermodal chassis, among other components and products.\nBased on the information obtained during the investigation and taking into account public comments, as\nwell as the advice of the interagency Section 301 Committee and advisory committees, the U.S. Trade\nRepresentative determined that China\u2019s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for\ndominance is actionable under Sections 301(b) and 304(a) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2411(b) and\n2414(a)).\nSpecifically, USTR found China\u2019s targeting for dominance unreasonable because it displaces foreign firms,\ndeprives market-oriented businesses and their workers of commercial opportunities, and lessens\ncompetition and creates dependencies on China, increasing risk and reducing supply chain resilience.\nChina\u2019s targeting for dominance is also unreasonable because of Beijing\u2019s extraordinary control over its\neconomic actors and these sectors.", "economic actors and these sectors.\nUSTR found that China\u2019s targeting for dominance burdens or restricts U.S. commerce by undercutting\nbusiness opportunities for and investments in the U.S. maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors;\nrestricting competition and choice; creating economic security risks from dependence and vulnerabilities\nin sectors critical to the functioning of the U.S. economy; and undermining supply chain resilience.\nOn February 21, 2025, USTR proposed Section 301 actions aimed to obtain the elimination of China\u2019s acts,\npolicies, and practices targeting the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance and will\nconsider public comments before taking final action.\n42 | II.

The Washington State measure was withdrawn in April 2020, and\nthe EU had no legal basis to retaliate. Furthermore, in exercising its $4 billion authorization, the EU relied\non a benchmark reference period affected by the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwhich enabled the EU to cover a greater volume of imports than if, like the United States, it had used data\nfrom a period when trade was not affected by the pandemic.\nOn December 31, 2020, in response to the EU\u2019s action, the United States announced certain revisions to\nthe August 2020 action, including an adjustment to mirror the benchmark period used by the EU in\nexercising its authorization (86 FR 674 of January 6, 2021). Using the new benchmark period, coupled\nwith appropriate adjustments, the December 31, 2020, revision remained consistent with the WTO", "with appropriate adjustments, the December 31, 2020, revision remained consistent with the WTO\narbitrator\u2019s award to the United States.\nIn February 2021, the U.S. Trade Representative together with the affected United States industry agreed\nthat it was unnecessary at that time to revise the action in the Section 301 investigation.

In 1996, the United States initiated a WTO dispute\nwith respect to the hormone ban. WTO panel and Appellate Body reports found that the measure was\ninconsistent with WTO obligation because the ban was not based on scientific evidence, a risk assessment,\nor relevant international standards. Under WTO procedures, the European Communities (EC), the\npredecessor to the EU, was to come into compliance with its obligations by May 13, 1999, but it failed to", "do so. Accordingly, in May 1999, the United States requested authorization from the Dispute Settlement\nBody (DSB) to suspend the application to the EC, and Member States thereof, of tariff concessions and\nrelated obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994. The EC did not\nII.

In 2008, the DSB adopted panel and Appellate Body reports that\nconfirmed that the July 1999 DSB authorization remained in effect.\nIn January 2009, the U.S. Trade Representative: (1) removed certain products from the 1999 list of products\nsubject to 100 percent ad valorem duties; (2) imposed 100 percent ad valorem duties on some new products\nfrom certain EU Member States; (3) modified the coverage with respect to particular EU Member States;", "and (4) raised the level of duties on one product. The trade value of the products subject to the modified\nlist did not exceed the $116.8 million per year authorized by the WTO.\nIn March 2009, the U.S. Trade Representative delayed the effective date of the additional duties (items two\nthrough four above) imposed under the January 2009 modifications in order to allow additional time for\nreaching an agreement with the EU. The effective date of the removal of duties under the January\nmodifications remained March 23, 2009. Accordingly, subsequent to March 23, 2009, the additional duties\nput in place in July 1999 remained applicable to a reduced list of products.\nIn May 2009, the United States and the EU concluded a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which,\nunder the first phase of the MOU scheduled to conclude in August 2012, obligated the EU to open a new\nduty-free tariff-rate quota (TRQ) for beef not produced with certain growth-promoting hormones.

Under phase two, the U.S. Trade Representative terminated the remaining\nadditional duties, and the EU expanded the TRQ from 20,000 to 45,000 metric tons. In August 2013, the\nUnited States and the EU extended phase two for an additional two years, until August 2015.\nOn December 9, 2016, representatives of the U.S. beef industry requested that the U.S. Trade\nRepresentative reinstate trade action against the EU because the TRQ was not providing benefits sufficient\nto compensate for the harm caused by the EU\u2019s hormone ban. On December 28, 2016, USTR published a\nFederal Register notice seeking public comments on specific EU products in order to consider possible", "reinstatement of duties.

Import relief is designed to redress the injury and to\nfacilitate positive adjustment by the domestic industry; it may consist of increased tariffs, quantitative\nrestrictions, or other forms of relief. Section 201 also authorizes the President to grant provisional relief in\ncases involving \u201ccritical circumstances\u201d or certain perishable agricultural products.\nFor an industry to obtain relief under Section 201, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) must\nfirst determine that a product is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be", "a substantial cause (a cause which is important and not less than any other cause) of serious injury, or the\nthreat thereof, to the U.S. industry producing a like or directly competitive product. If the USITC makes\nan affirmative injury determination and recommends a remedy to the President, the President may provide\nrelief either in the form recommended by the USITC or in such other form as the President finds appropriate.\nThe criteria for import relief in Section 201 are based on Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade 1994, commonly referred to as the \u201cescape clause,\u201d and the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nAgreement on Safeguards.\nSection 204(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 also requires the USITC to monitor developments with respect\nto the domestic industry following the President\u2019s determination to impose a safeguard measure.

First, the Panel found that China\u2019s restrictions on\nforeign invested enterprises (and in some cases foreign individuals) from importing films for theatrical\nrelease, audiovisual home entertainment products, sound recordings, and publications are inconsistent with\nChina\u2019s trading rights commitments as set forth in China\u2019s protocol of accession to the WTO. The Panel\nalso found that China\u2019s restrictions on the right to import these products are not justified by Article XX(a)\nof the GATT 1994.

The parties\nset a three-month time frame for the negotiations and agreed that, during negotiations, they would not\nrequest panel proceedings.\nThe United States and the EU were unable to reach an agreement within the 90-day time frame. Therefore,\nthe United States filed a request for a panel on May 31, 2005. The Panel was established on July 20, 2005.", "The U.S. request challenged several types of EU subsidies that appear to be prohibited, actionable, or both.\nOn October 17, 2005, the Deputy Director-General composed the Panel as follows: Mr. Carlos P\u00e9rez del\nCastillo, Chair; and Mr. John Adank and Mr. Thinus Jacobsz, Members.\nThe Panel issued its report on June 30, 2010. It agreed with the United States that the disputed measures\nof the EU, France, Germany, Spain, and the UK were inconsistent with the SCM Agreement. In particular:\n\u2022 Every instance of \u201claunch aid\u201d provided to Airbus was a subsidy because in each case, the terms\ncharged for this unique low interest, success-dependent financing were more favorable than were\navailable in the market.\n\u2022 Some of the launch aid provided for the A380, Airbus\u2019s newest and largest aircraft, was contingent\non exports and, therefore, a prohibited subsidy.\n\u2022 Several instances in which German and French government entities created infrastructure for", "\u2022 Several instances in which German and French government entities created infrastructure for\nAirbus were subsidies because the infrastructure was not general, and the price charged to Airbus\nfor use resulted in less than adequate remuneration to the government.\n\u2022 Several government equity infusions into the Airbus companies were subsidies because they were\non more favorable terms than available in the market.\n\u2022 Several EU and Member State research programs provided grants to Airbus to develop technologies\nused in its aircraft.\n\u2022 These subsidies caused adverse effects to the interests of the United States in the form of lost sales,\ndisplacement of U.S. imports into the EU market, and displacement of U.S. exports into the markets\nof Australia, Brazil, China, Korea, Mexico, Singapore, and Chinese Taipei.\nThe EU filed a notice of appeal on July 21, 2010. The Appellate Body held two hearings on the issues", "raised in the EU\u2019s appeal of the Panel\u2019s findings of WTO inconsistent subsidization of Airbus. The first\nhearing, held November 11 to November 17, 2010, addressed issues associated with the main subsidy to\nAirbus, launch aid, and the other subsidies challenged by the United States. The second hearing held\nDecember 9 to December 14, 2010, focused on the Panel\u2019s findings that the European subsidies caused\nserious prejudice to the interests of the United States in the form of lost sales and declining market share in\nthe EU and other third-country markets. On May 18, 2011, the Appellate Body issued its report. The\n74 | II. TRADE ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES AND ACTIONS\nAppellate Body affirmed the Panel\u2019s central findings that European government launch aid had been used\nto support the creation of every model of large civil aircraft produced by Airbus. The Appellate Body also\nconfirmed that launch aid and other challenged subsidies to Airbus have directly resulted in Boeing losing", "sales involving purchases of Airbus aircraft by EasyJet, Air Berlin, Czech Airlines, Air Asia, Iberia, South\nAfrican Airways, Thai Airways International, Singapore Airlines, Emirates Airlines, and Qantas, as well\nas lost market share, with Airbus gaining market share in the EU and in third-country markets, including\nChina and Korea, at the expense of Boeing. The Appellate Body also found that the Panel applied the\nwrong standard for evaluating whether subsidies are export subsidies, and that the Panel record did not have\nenough information to allow application of the correct standard.\nOn December 1, 2011, the EU provided a notification in which it claimed to have complied with the DSB\nrecommendations and rulings. On December 9, 2011, the United States requested consultations regarding\nthe notification and also requested authorization from the DSB to impose countermeasures. The United\nStates and the EU held consultations on January 13, 2012. On December 22, 2011, the EU objected to the", "level of suspension of concessions requested by the United States, and the matter was referred to arbitration\npursuant to Article 22.6 of the DSU. On January 19, 2012, the United States and the EU requested that the\narbitration be suspended pending the conclusion of the compliance proceeding.\nOn March 30, 2012, in light of the Parties\u2019 disagreement over whether the EU had complied with the DSB\u2019s\nrecommendations and rulings, the United States requested that the DSB refer the matter to the original Panel\npursuant to Article 21.5 of the DSU. The DSB did so at a meeting held on April 13, 2012. On April 25,\n2012, the compliance Panel was composed with the members of the original Panel: Mr. Carlos P\u00e9rez del\nCastillo, Chair; and Mr. John Adank and Mr. Thinus Jacobsz, Members.\nOn September 22, 2016, the report of the Article 21.5 Panel was circulated to the Members. The Panel\nfound that the EU breached Articles 5(c) and 6.3(a), (b), and (c) of the SCM Agreement, and that the EU", "and certain Member States failed to comply with the DSB recommendations under Article 7.8 of the SCM\nAgreement to \u201ctake appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or \u2026 withdraw the subsidy.\u201d\nSignificant findings by the compliance Panel against the EU include:\n\u2022 34 out of 36 alleged compliance \u201csteps\u201d notified by the EU did not amount to \u201cactions\u201d with respect\nto the subsidies provided to the Airbus or the adverse effects that those subsidies were to have\ncaused in the original proceeding.\n\u2022 As a result, the EU failed to withdraw the subsidies, as recommended by the DSB.\n\u2022 Those subsidies were a genuine and substantial cause of lost sales to U.S. aircraft, and displacement\nand impedance of exports of U.S. aircraft to Australia, China, India, Korea, Singapore, and the\nUnited Arab Emirates.\nOn October 13, 2016, the EU notified the DSB of its decision to appeal certain issues of law and legal", "interpretations developed by the compliance panel.

The Appellate Body confirmed that the EU and\ncertain Member States failed to comply with the earlier WTO determination finding launch aid inconsistent\nwith their WTO obligations. The Appellate Body further confirmed that almost $5 billion in new launch\naid for the A350 XWB was WTO-inconsistent. The Appellate Body found that the WTO-inconsistent\nsubsidies continue to cause significant lost sales of Boeing aircraft in the twin-aisle and very large aircraft\nmarkets, and that these subsidies impede exports of Boeing 747 aircraft to numerous geographic markets.\nII. TRADE ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES AND ACTIONS | 75\nThe Appellate Body also found that, due to the passage of time, the EU no longer needed to take action", "regarding some of the earlier (i.e., pre-A380) launch aid subsidies previously found to be WTO-\ninconsistent.\nOn July 13, 2018, at the request of the United States, the arbitration regarding the level of countermeasures\n(suspended in January 2012) was resumed. On October 2, 2019, the Arbitrator issued its decision that the\nlevel of countermeasures commensurate with the degree and nature of the adverse effects determined to\nexist is up to $7.50 billion annually. On October 14, 2019, the WTO accordingly authorized the United\nStates to take countermeasures consistent with the award of the Arbitrator. The United States imposed\ntariffs on certain imports from the involved EU member states pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act.\nOn May 17, 2018, the EU represented to the DSB that it had taken new steps to achieve compliance with\nits WTO obligations. However, following consultations, the United States did not agree that the EU had", "achieved compliance. At the request of the EU, the WTO established a second compliance panel on August\n27, 2018.\nOn December 2, 2019, the second compliance Panel issued its report. The Panel found that the EU\ncontinued to be in breach of Articles 5(c) and 6.3(a), (b), and (c) of the SCM Agreement, and that the EU\nand certain Member States had accordingly failed to comply with the DSB recommendations under Article\n7.8 of the SCM Agreement to \u201ctake appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or \u2026 withdraw the\nsubsidy.\u201d The Panel agreed with the United States that none of the measures taken by the four EU Member\nStates amounted to a withdrawal of the launch aid for the A350XWB and A380. The Panel also found that\nthat launch aid for the A380 and A350XWB continued to be a genuine and substantial cause of lost sales\nto U.S. aircraft, and impedance of exports of U.S. aircraft to China, India, Korea, Singapore, and the United\nArab Emirates.", "Arab Emirates.\nOn December 6, 2019, the EU notified the DSB of its decision to appeal certain findings of the compliance\nPanel.\nOn June 15 and June 17, 2021, the United States reached understandings on cooperative frameworks with\nthe EU and the UK, respectively, on the parallel aircraft disputes (DS316 and DS353). In accordance with\nthe understandings, each side intends not to impose any WTO-authorized countermeasures for a period of\nfive years starting from July 4, 2021. Each side also intends to provide any financing to its large civil\naircraft producer (LCA producer) for the production or development of large civil aircraft on market terms.\nAdditionally, each side intends to provide any funding for research and development (R&D) for large civil\naircraft to its LCA producer through an open and transparent process while making the results of fully\ngovernment funded R&D widely available.

Successful resolution of specific IP issues of\nconcern can lead to a positive change in a trading partner\u2019s Special 301 status outside of the typical period\nfor the annual review.\nUSTR also conducts a review focused on prominent and illustrative examples of online and physical\nmarkets that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial piracy or counterfeiting. USTR started identifying\nnotorious markets in the Special 301 Report in 2006. In 2010, USTR began publishing the Notorious\nMarkets List (NML) separately from the Special 301 Report in order to increase public awareness and guide\nrelated enforcement efforts. Since publication of the first NML, several online markets closed or saw their", "business models disrupted as a result of enforcement efforts. In some instances, in an effort to legitimize\ntheir overall business, companies made the decision to close down problematic aspects of their operations;\nwhile others cooperated with authorities to address unauthorized conduct on their sites. Notwithstanding\nthe progress that has occurred, online piracy and counterfeiting continue to grow, requiring robust,\nsustained, and coordinated responses by governments, private sector stakeholders, and consumers.\nThe NML also includes an \u201cissue focus\u201d that highlights an issue related to the facilitation of substantial\ntrademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy. As announced in the Federal Register notice published on\nAugust 16, 2024, the issue focus for the 2024 NML will examine illicit online pharmacies and counterfeit\nmedicine.\nThe Special 301 Review and NML serve a critical function by identifying opportunities and challenges in", "foreign markets related to adequate and effective IP protection and enforcement facing U.S. innovative and\ncreative industries, which are key industries for job creation and economic development.

Most Section 337\ninvestigations concern alleged infringement of intellectual property rights, such as U.S. patents.\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) conducts Section 337 investigations through\nadjudicatory proceedings under the Administrative Procedure Act. The proceedings normally involve an\nevidentiary hearing before a USITC administrative law judge who issues an Initial Determination that is\nsubject to review by the USITC (all sitting commissioners). If the USITC finds a violation, it can order\nthat imported infringing goods be excluded from entry into the United States, issue cease and desist orders", "requiring firms to stop unlawful conduct in the United States, such as the sale or other distribution of\nimported infringing goods in the United States, or both.

Many Section 337 investigations are terminated after the\nparties reach settlement agreements or agree to the entry of consent orders. In cases in which the USITC\nfinds a violation of Section 337, it must decide whether certain public interest factors nevertheless preclude\nthe issuance of a remedial order. The four public interest considerations are the order\u2019s effect on: (1) public\nhealth and welfare; (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy; (3) the production of like or directly", "competitive articles in the United States; and (4) U.S. consumers.

The Department of Homeland Security U.S. Customs and Border\nProtection enforces USITC exclusion and seizure orders.\nIf the USITC issues an affirmative determination and concomitant remedial order(s), it transmits the\ndetermination, order(s), and the record upon which the determination is based to the President for policy\nreview. The Presidential review, set out in Section 337(j)(1)(B), Section 337(j)(2), and Section 337(j)(4)\nof the Tariff Act of 1930, has been delegated to the United States Trade Representative (USTR).

Antidumping Actions\nUnder the U.S. antidumping law, duties are imposed on imported merchandise when the U.S. Department\nof Commerce (Commerce) determines that the merchandise is being dumped (sold at \u201cless than fair value\u201d)\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) determines that there is material injury or threat of\nmaterial injury to the domestic industry, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry, \u201cby\nreason of\u201d those imports. The antidumping law\u2019s provisions are incorporated in Title VII of the Tariff Act\nof 1930 and have been substantially amended by the Trade Agreements Act of l979, the Trade and Tariff\nAct of 1984, the Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994,\nand the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015.", "and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015.\nAn antidumping investigation usually begins when a U.S. industry, or an entity filing on its behalf, submits\na petition alleging, with respect to certain imports, the dumping and injury elements described above.

Countervailing Duty Actions\nThe U.S. countervailing duty (CVD) law dates back to late 19th century legislation authorizing the\nimposition of CVDs on subsidized sugar imports. The current CVD provisions are contained in Title VII\nof the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by subsequent legislation including the Uruguay Round Agreements\nAct of 1994. As with the antidumping law, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) and the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce (Commerce) jointly administer the CVD law, and the U.S. Department of\nHomeland Security Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects duties and enforces CVD orders on\nimported goods.\nThe CVD law\u2019s purpose is to offset certain foreign government subsidies that benefit imports into the", "United States. CVD procedures under Title VII are very similar to antidumping procedures, and CVD\ndeterminations by Commerce and the USITC are subject to the same system of judicial review as\nantidumping determinations. Commerce normally initiates investigations based on a petition submitted by\na U.S. industry or an entity filing on its behalf. The USITC is responsible for investigating material injury\nissues. The USITC makes a preliminary finding as to whether there is a reasonable indication of material\ninjury or threat of material injury, or material retardation of an industry\u2019s establishment, by reason of\nimports subject to investigation. If the USITC\u2019s preliminary determination is negative, the investigation\nterminates; otherwise, Commerce issues preliminary and final determinations on subsidization.

Section 751 also provides for Commerce\nand USITC review in cases of changed circumstances and periodic review in conformity with the five-year\n\u201csunset\u201d provisions of the U.S. countervailing duty law.\nCVD determinations may be appealed to the U.S. Court of International Trade with further judicial review", "possible in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. For certain\ninvestigations involving Canadian or Mexican merchandise, final determinations may be reviewed by a\nbinational panel established under the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement.\nThe United States initiated 34 CVD investigations and imposed 10 new CVD orders during 2024.\n7. Subsidies Monitoring and Other Antidumping and Countervailing Duty\nEnforcement\nSubsidies Enforcement\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM\nAgreement) establishes multilateral disciplines on subsidies. Among its various disciplines, the SCM\nAgreement provides remedies for subsidies that have adverse effects not only in the importing country\u2019s\nmarket, but also in the subsidizing government\u2019s market and in third-country markets. The SCM\nAgreement also obligates all WTO Members to file biennial notifications of all specific subsidies that they", "maintain. This transparency is fundamental to assessing the nature and extent of Members\u2019 subsidy\nprograms and their likely impact on trade, and to utilizing the remedies permitted under the Agreement.\nPrior to the SCM Agreement coming into effect in 1995, the U.S. countervailing duty (CVD) law was, in\neffect, the only practical mechanism for U.S. companies to address subsidized foreign competition.\nHowever, the CVD law focuses exclusively on the effects of foreign subsidized competition in the United\nStates. Although the procedures and remedies are different, the multilateral remedies of the SCM\nAgreement provide an alternative tool to address foreign subsidies that affect U.S. businesses in an\nincreasingly global marketplace.\nSection 281 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 (URAA) and other authorities set out the\nresponsibilities of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the U.S. Department", "of Commerce (Commerce) in enforcing U.S. rights in the WTO under the SCM Agreement. USTR\ncoordinates the development and implementation of overall U.S. trade policy with respect to subsidy\nmatters; represents the United States in the WTO, including in the WTO Committee on Subsidies and\nCountervailing Measures and in WTO dispute settlement relating to subsidies disciplines; and leads the\ninteragency team on matters of policy. The role of Commerce\u2019s Enforcement and Compliance (E&C) is to\nenforce the CVD law and, in accordance with responsibilities assigned by the Congress in the URAA, to\npursue certain subsidies enforcement activities of the United States with respect to the disciplines embodied\nin the SCM Agreement. The E&C\u2019s Subsidies Enforcement Office (SEO) is the specific office charged\nwith carrying out these duties.\nThe primary mandate of the SEO is to examine subsidy complaints and concerns raised by U.S. exporting", "companies and to monitor foreign subsidy practices to determine whether there is reason to believe they are\nimpeding U.S. exports to foreign markets and are inconsistent with the SCM Agreement. Once sufficient\nII. TRADE ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES AND ACTIONS | 117\ninformation about a subsidy practice has been gathered to permit it to be reliably evaluated, USTR and\nCommerce confer with an interagency team to determine the most effective way to proceed. It is frequently\nadvantageous to pursue resolution of these problems through a combination of informal and formal\ncontacts, including, where warranted, dispute settlement action in the WTO. Remedies for violations of\nthe SCM Agreement may, under certain circumstances, involve the withdrawal of a subsidy program or the\nelimination of the adverse effects of the program.\nDuring 2024, USTR and E&C addressed numerous inquiries and met with representatives of U.S. industries", "concerned with the subsidization of foreign competitors. These efforts continued to be importantly\nenhanced by E&C officers stationed overseas (e.g., in the People\u2019s Republic of China), who help gather,\nclarify, and check the accuracy of information concerning foreign subsidy practices. U.S. Government\nofficers stationed at U.S. Embassies where E&C are not present also handled such inquiries.\nThe SEO\u2019s electronic subsidies database continued to fulfill the goal of providing the U.S. trading\ncommunity with a centralized location to obtain information about the remedies available under the SCM\nAgreement and much of the information that is needed to develop a CVD case or a WTO subsidies\ncomplaint. This database is accessible to the public through the SEO website. The website includes an\noverview of the SEO, helpful links, and an easily navigable tool that provides information about each\nsubsidy program investigated by Commerce in CVD cases since 1980. This database is frequently updated,", "making information on subsidy programs quickly available to the public.\nMonitoring and Challenging Foreign Antidumping, Countervailing Duty, and Safeguard Actions\nThe WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article VI (Antidumping Agreement) and the SCM Agreement\npermit WTO Members to impose antidumping (AD) duties or CVDs to offset injurious dumping or\nsubsidization of products exported from one Member to another. The United States actively monitors,\nevaluates, and where appropriate, participates in ongoing AD and CVD cases conducted by foreign\ncountries in order to safeguard the interests of U.S. industry and to ensure that Members abide by their\nWTO obligations in conducting such proceedings.\nTo this end, the United States works closely with U.S. companies affected by foreign countries\u2019 AD and\nCVD investigations in an effort to help them better understand WTO Members\u2019 AD and CVD systems.", "CVD investigations in an effort to help them better understand WTO Members\u2019 AD and CVD systems.\nThe United States also advocates on their behalf in connection with ongoing investigations, with the goal\nof obtaining fair and objective treatment that is consistent with the WTO agreements. In addition, with\nregard to CVD cases, the United States provides extensive information in response to questions from\nforeign governments regarding the subsidy allegations at issue in a particular case.\nFurther, E&C\u2019s Trade Remedy Compliance Staff (TRCS) track foreign AD and CVD actions, as well as\nsafeguard actions involving U.S. exporters, enabling U.S. companies and U.S. Government agencies to\nmonitor other WTO Members\u2019 administration of such actions. Information about foreign trade remedy\nactions affecting U.S. exports is accessible to the public via the TRCS\u2019s website. The stationing of E&C\nofficers to certain overseas locations and close contacts with U.S. Government officers stationed in", "embassies worldwide has contributed to U.S. efforts to monitor the application of foreign trade remedy\nlaws with respect to U.S. exports. In addition, E&C promotes fair treatment, transparency, and consistency\nwith WTO obligations through technical exchanges and other bilateral engagements.\nDuring the past year, several trade remedy actions involving exports from the United States were closely\nmonitored, notable examples of which include: (1) India\u2019s separate AD investigations of isobutylene-\nisoprene rubber and halo-isobutene-isoprene rubber; (2) the European Union\u2019s AD investigation of\npolyvinyl chloride; and (3) Colombia\u2019s CVD investigation of milk powder.\n118 | II.

The notice sought\ninformation on developing sector-specific policy tools, strengthening domestic manufacturing and services,\ncollaborating with like-minded trading partners and allies, and measuring resilience, among other topics.\nOver the course of May 2024, USTR received testimony from 84 witnesses in Washington, D.C.; St. Paul,", "Minnesota; and New York, New York, as well as virtually. The comment docket is public and contains\nnearly 300 submissions from a wide range of stakeholders, including labor unions and labor rights non-\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs), think tanks, environmental NGOs, and companies and trade\nassociations, as well as foreign governments.\nIn addition, USTR continued to work with trading partners to address non-market policies and practices\n(NMPPs) in trade that contribute to overconcentration of production, non-market excess capacity, and other\ndistortions in the market that can lead to the development of single sources of key strategic products and\nundermine supply chain diversity, security, and resilience. For example, in 2024, the United States and the\nEuropean Union (EU) exchanged views and information about NMPPs in the medical devices sector in\nChina and their adverse impact on U.S. and EU workers and businesses and explored possible coordinated", "actions in response to these policies and practices.\nFor further discussion on non-market policies and practices, see Section II.E. Enforcement Activities to\nCounter Non-Market Policies and Practices and Enhance Economic Security.\nCritical Minerals\nTo support resilient critical minerals supply chains, USTR engaged with key trading partners to facilitate\ntrade, promote fair competition and market-oriented conditions for trade in critical minerals, advance robust\nlabor and environmental standards, and advance cooperation in this sector. The United States continued\nnegotiations of critical minerals agreements with the EU and the United Kingdom and continued to engage\nwith Japan under the United States\u2013Japan Critical Minerals Agreement concluded on March 28, 2023.\nFor further discussion, see Section I.D.2 regarding the United States\u2013United Kingdom Critical Minerals\nAgreement and United States\u2013European Union Critical Minerals Agreement and see Section I.D.3 United", "Agreement and United States\u2013European Union Critical Minerals Agreement and see Section I.D.3 United\nStates\u2013Japan Critical Minerals Agreement.\nSteel and Aluminum\nSteel and aluminum are important strategic sectors that are severely impacted by non-market excess\ncapacity and other NMPPs. Excess capacity in steel, aluminum, and other industrial sectors is generally\ncaused by the expansion or maintenance of uneconomic production capacity without regard for domestic\ndemand conditions, ultimately producing more product than can be consumed in the home market, fueling\nmassive exports. These massive exports put downward pressure on global prices and displace products in\nthe export markets. Non-market excess capacity\u2014excess capacity driven by other NMPPs\u2014poses an\n154 | III. SECTORAL PROGRAMS, AGREEMENTS, NEGOTIATIONS, AND OTHER INITIATIVES\nexistential threat to market-oriented steel and aluminum industries. For U.S. steel and aluminum producers,", "non-market excess capacity is also a significant barrier that precludes meaningful competition for sales in\nforeign markets. Excess capacity also restrains U.S. exports of steel- and aluminum-intensive downstream\nproducts, as countries with substantial excess capacity are attempting to move up the value chain, thereby\ndisplacing American manufacturers and downstream products.\nIn 2024, USTR continued to seek opportunities to work with like-minded trading partners to build\ninternational consensus on the challenges of excess capacity, including in the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) Steel Committee, which brings together government, industry, and\nlabor representatives to discuss developments across the global steel sector and approaches to addressing\nchallenges.\nIn addition, in 2024, USTR worked with like-minded partners in the OECD-facilitated Global Forum on", "In addition, in 2024, USTR worked with like-minded partners in the OECD-facilitated Global Forum on\nSteel Excess Capacity (GFSEC) to consider new approaches that effectively address the root causes and\nconsequences of excess capacity, taking into account that the situation is worsening and, so far, existing\napproaches and international trade rules have had limited impact.\nThe United States continued to strengthen actions to address the national security threat posed by steel and\naluminum imports. On July 10, 2024, the United States implemented melt and pour, and smelt and cast\nrequirements, respectively, for certain steel and aluminum imports from Mexico under Section 232 of the\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962. In order to be eligible for importation free from Section 232 tariffs, steel\narticles and derivative steel articles that are products of Mexico must be melted and poured in Mexico,", "Canada, or the United States, and aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are products of\nMexico must not contain primary aluminum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary\ncountry of smelt, or country of most recent cast is China, Russia, Belarus, or Iran. To improve transparency\nof the origins of its imports, Mexico began requiring its importers to provide more information about the\ncountry of origin of steel products. These actions will help jointly prevent tariff evasion on steel and\naluminum and strengthen North American steel and aluminum supply chains.\nSemiconductors\nUSTR engages on a wide range of trade-related issues that impact the semiconductor industry to help\npromote the resilience and security of the industry\u2019s supply chain, support domestic manufacturing, and\nlevel the playing field for the U.S. semiconductor industry. USTR, in close collaboration with interagency", "partners, routinely engages with allies and partners to cooperate on semiconductor supply chains and work\nto address unfair trade practices. Under the United States\u2013European Union Trade and Technology Council\n(TTC), the United States and the EU shared concerns about the impact of NMPPs on the global supply of\nsemiconductors, particularly in legacy chips. To avoid negative spillover effects from global non-market\nexcess capacity, the United States and the EU, in cooperation with like-minded partners, continued to\nexchange information and market intelligence about NMPPs that undermine the well-being of the global\nsemiconductor industry, and explored cooperative measures to address the distortionary effects of these\npolicies and practices. In addition to the engagements in the TTC, over the past two years the United States,\nthe EU, and Japan deepened their trilateral work, focusing on the identification of problems arising from", "NMPPs, including in sectors such as legacy semiconductor chips. The three trading partners have also\nsought to identify gaps in existing trade tools and, where further work is needed, to develop new trade tools\nto address NMPPs, as well as possible cooperation in utilizing existing tools.\nThe G7, under the Italian Presidency in March 2024, established a semiconductor G7 Point of Contact\nGroup to bolster coordination on issues impacting the critical industry and work to promote resiliency in\nsupply chains.

The\nUSMCA provisions ensure that its benefits go to products genuinely made in the United States and\nelsewhere in North America and incentivize production in North America. These provisions include\nupdated rules of origin for automobiles and automotive parts that require greater North American content,\nincluding mandatory purchase requirements for North American steel and aluminum, and requirements to", "produce certain core parts and components within the region. On July 1, 2024, USTR published the second\nbiennial Report on the Operation of the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA) with Respect\nto Trade in Automotive Goods, pursuant to Section 202A(g)(1) of the United States-Mexico-Canada\nAgreement Implementation Act (P.L. 116-113).\nUSMCA also included new provisions in Chapter 12 (Sectoral Annexes) that promote enhanced regulatory\ncompatibility and best regulatory practices in key sectors. In 2023, USTR worked with Canada and Mexico\nto initiate a review of the implementation of Chapter 12, starting with medical devices. A key outcome was\nthat the Mexican regulator (COFEPRIS) joined the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) as an\naffiliate member in late 2023, which will aid in standardizing the regulatory audit process among USMCA\npartners and promote greater alignment of regulatory approaches and technical requirements for medical", "devices based on international standards and best practices. In 2024, COFEPRIS also became an affiliate\nmember of the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), a voluntary group of medical\ndevice regulators (including USMCA partners), which aims to accelerate international medical device\nregulatory harmonization and convergence.\nU.S.\u2013Switzerland Pharmaceutical Good Manufacturing Practices Mutual Recognition Agreement\nThe Agreement on Mutual Recognition Between the Swiss Confederation and United States of America\nRelating to Pharmaceutical Good Manufacturing Practice (MRA) entered into force on July 27, 2023. The\nMRA allows U.S. and Swiss regulators to share documents from their routine good manufacturing practice\n(GMP) inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, thereby reducing duplicative efforts. In\n2024, the United States and Switzerland worked together to implement the MRA in an effort to make sure", "their regulators could better exercise their respective regulatory discretion to re-allocate resources to where\nthey would be most needed, thereby helping to ensure that all drugs imported into each country were as\nsafe as possible.\nRemanufacturing\nRemanufacturing is an important part of the manufacturing sector and allows manufacturers to service the\nequipment they sell and develop or to expand their customer base through high-quality but lower priced\nremanufactured products. Remanufacturing extends the life and thus the reach of innovative products,\nmaking a wide range of goods more cost-effective and accessible to more consumers. Further,\nremanufacturing is an essential element of the circular economy. It reuses resources, such as metals, with\n156 | III.

In addition to commitments supporting trade in remanufactured\ngoods in recent trade agreements, including the USMCA, USTR has advanced remanufacturing in a range\nof venues. In 2024, USTR continued work under the APEC Pathfinder on Facilitating Trade in\nRemanufactured Goods and led a workshop on remanufactured consumer electronic products at the Third\nSenior Officials Meeting (SOM3) in Lima, Peru, in August. USTR also continued advocating for and\ndiscussing the role of remanufacturing in circular economy approaches to goods at the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions (TESSD). In", "Organization (WTO) Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions (TESSD). In\naddition, USTR worked bilaterally with trading partners to develop capacity in supporting remanufacturing\nthrough trade policies.\nBilateral Market Access Barriers\nThroughout 2024, USTR continued to address a broad range of manufactured goods market access barriers\nthrough extensive engagement with trading partners, including through formal trade and investment\nframework agreement meetings, free trade agreement meetings, and various bilateral trade policy initiatives\nand activities. Among such activities in 2024 were continued efforts to address barriers resulting from a\nrange of China\u2019s NMPPs, such as targeting industrial sectors for dominance, non-market excess capacity,\nforced labor and other labor rights violations, and distorting activities of firms that are state-owned or state-\nsponsored, or whose market power is directly supported by government, thereby undermining U.S.", "sponsored, or whose market power is directly supported by government, thereby undermining U.S.\neconomic security, including economic security for working people. As noted, such policies and practices\ncan potentially lead to non-market excess capacity that has harmful impacts to foreign competitors, similar\nto what has already occurred in sectors such as steel and aluminum.\nElsewhere, USTR worked to level the playing field for key manufactured exports, such as automotive goods\nand agricultural equipment, by seeking tariff reductions and addressing technical standards that put U.S.\nexports at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, USTR has used the WTO Committees such as the\nCommittee on Market Access and the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade to raise specific issues,\noften in collaboration with other trading partners. USTR has also used bilateral engagements, including\ntrade and investment framework agreements with certain partners, to raise concerns with barriers to trade", "in manufactured goods, including tariffs, local testing requirements, and import licensing issues.\nStrong Enforcement\nThroughout all of these policy activities relating to manufacturing and trade, the U.S. Government\naggressively stood up for American interests and protected American economic security for working people\nby taking tough enforcement action against countries that break the rules, applying the full range of tools\navailable, including WTO rules, negotiations, litigation, and other mechanisms under U.S. law. For\nexample, USTR continues to work with the EU and the United Kingdom to advance discussions under\nagreements on large civil aircraft that were reached with each partner in 2021, which worked to level the\nplaying field for a major U.S. manufacturing sector and laid the basis to more effectively address the\nchallenges that Chinese industrial policies pose in this sector.\nOn May 13, 2024, USTR issued a report on the findings of the Section 301 four-year review of China\u2019s", "acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation.

USTR worked closely with USAID, the U.S. Department of State, and other\nagencies to track and guide the delivery of TCB assistance related to FTA commitments.\nFor further discussion, see the individual country sections in Chapter I.C Comprehensive Free Trade\nAgreements in Force, Chapter III.C.2 Environment and Trade, Monitoring and Enforcement Activities of\nExisting Agreements, and Chapter III.E.2 Labor and Trade, Monitoring and Enforcement Activities of\nExisting Agreements.", "Existing Agreements.\n5. Standards Alliance\nThe Standards Alliance is a public-private partnership between USAID and the American National\nStandards Institute (ANSI), which is the official U.S. representative to the International Organization for\nStandardization. The goal of this partnership is to build capacity among developing countries to implement\nthe WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement).\nAs the implementing partner of the Standards Alliance, ANSI coordinates private sector subject matter\nexperts from its member organizations to deliver training and other technical exchange with eligible and\ninterested Standards Alliance countries on international standards, best practices, and other subjects\nsupporting implementation of the TBT Agreement. In consultation with the Trade Policy Staff Committee\nand private sector experts, ANSI requested and reviewed applications for assistance, considering bilateral", "trade opportunities, available private sector expertise that may be leveraged, demonstrated commitment and\nreadiness for assistance, and potential development impact.\nPhase 2 (2019-2026) of the Standards Alliance program commits funds to help increase the capacity of\ndeveloping countries to implement accepted international best practices to reduce instances of poor quality\nand unsafe products, services, and infrastructure. Areas of cooperation include: medical devices; and\nwater, sanitation, and hygiene.\nAs of December 31, 2024, under Phase 2, the Standards Alliance had engaged with more than 6,000\nparticipants from 28 countries to develop national standards regimes, support governments in implementing\ninternational trade obligations, and enhance public-private dialogue on standards and technical regulations.\nIn addition to mobilizing more than $6 million in technical assistance to support countries\u2019 response to the", "COVID-19 pandemic, the Standards Alliance has deployed more than $4 million in technical assistance\nduring Phase 2 to support standardization for biofuels, water and sanitation systems, water quality\nimprovement, and maternal and child health, benefiting millions of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin\nAmerica.\nIV.

INTRODUCTION\nThis chapter describes activities in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2024, including in the WTO\nStanding Committees and their subsidiary bodies, WTO negotiating groups, plurilateral initiatives,\nengagement on implementation and enforcement of WTO Agreements, and progress with accessions of\nnew Members.\nAt the Thirteenth WTO Ministerial Conference (MC13) in February 2024, Members took stock of progress\nmade on a forward-looking reform agenda. Members made significant progress on dispute settlement\nreform through a collaborative, interest-based approach. Members adopted Ministerial Decisions on", "reform through a collaborative, interest-based approach. Members adopted Ministerial Decisions on\nseveral other important topics. This included agreeing to continue the Work Program on Electronic\nCommerce and to extend the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions.\nMembers also agreed to extend the moratorium on initiating non-violation and situation complaints under\nthe TRIPS Agreement until the next Ministerial Conference.\nAdditionally, Members delivered several significant development outcomes at MC13. Members welcomed\nthe accession of two least-developed country (LDC) Members, the Union of the Comoros and Timor-Leste.\nMembers also ensured that Members graduating from the LDC category will have a smooth and sustainable\ntransition; decided to support developing Members\u2019 capacity to effectively utilize the Agreement on\nTechnical Barriers to Trade and the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; supported a work", "program for small and vulnerable economies; and instructed the Committee on Trade and Development to\nhold dedicated sessions on issues important to land-locked developing countries.\nWhile WTO Members were not able to reach consensus on an agricultural deliverable for MC13, the United\nStates played a key role advocating for a reform-oriented outcome, including with respect to export\nrestrictions of food destined for LDCs.\nAt MC12, WTO Members had committed to continue the fisheries subsidies negotiations with a view to\nmaking recommendations to MC13 for additional provisions that would achieve comprehensive disciplines\non harmful fisheries subsidies, including disciplines on certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute\nto overcapacity and overfishing. After several months of intensive negotiations in the run up to MC13,\nMembers were ultimately unable to reach consensus on this second phase of negotiations. As of December", "31, 2024, the second phase of the WTO fisheries subsidies negotiations was ongoing.\nOn a day-to-day basis, the WTO operates through its more than 20 standing committees (not including\nadditional working groups, working parties, and negotiating bodies). These groups meet regularly, enabling\nWTO Members to exchange views, monitor and resolve questions about Members\u2019 compliance with\ncommitments, and develop initiatives aimed at systemic improvements. These groups also serve to promote\nbasic transparency in Members\u2019 trade policies. Through discussions in these fora, Members can pursue\ndetailed information on individual Members\u2019 trade policy actions in light of WTO rules, and collectively\nconsider their impact on individual Members and the trading system as a whole. The discussions enable\nMembers in their domestic policymaking to assess and potentially address concerns raised by other WTO", "Members. The United States also takes advantage of opportunities in standing committees to consider ways\nto improve implementation of existing WTO provisions and to discuss areas where future rules could be\ndeveloped.\nV.

THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION\nB. WTO NEGOTIATIONS\nCommittee on Agriculture Special Session\nIn 2024, the U.S. Government, led by USTR, engaged actively in the Committee on Agriculture Special\nSession (CoA-SS) to ensure that WTO negotiations took into account the priorities and sensitivities of U.S.", "agricultural stakeholders, as well as global food security considerations. While WTO Members were not\nable to reach consensus on an agricultural deliverable for the Thirteenth WTO Ministerial Conference\n(MC13) in February 2024, the United States played a key role advocating for a reform-oriented outcome\nand resisting efforts by certain WTO Members to erode WTO rules.\nWTO Fisheries Subsidies\nAfter more than two decades of negotiations, WTO Members achieved a groundbreaking agreement at the\nTwelfth WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12) in June 2022. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies\n(Agreement) is the first ever multilateral trade agreement at the WTO with environmental sustainability at\nits core. The Agreement contains several important disciplines, including prohibitions on subsidies to\nvessels or operators engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) fishing, subsidies for", "fishing overfished stocks, and subsidies for fishing on the unregulated high seas. The Agreement also\nincludes robust transparency provisions to strengthen WTO Members\u2019 notification of fisheries subsidies\nand thereby enable effective monitoring of Members\u2019 implementation of their obligations. In April 2023,\nthe United States submitted its instrument of acceptance of the Agreement, making it the first major fishing\nnation to do so.\nAt MC12, WTO Members committed to continue the fisheries subsidies negotiations with a view to making\nrecommendations to MC13 for additional provisions that would achieve comprehensive disciplines on\nharmful fisheries subsidies, including disciplines on certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to\novercapacity and overfishing. After several months of intensive negotiations in the lead up to MC13, WTO\nMembers were ultimately unable to reach consensus on this second phase of negotiations. Following", "Members were ultimately unable to reach consensus on this second phase of negotiations. Following\nMC13, WTO Members resumed negotiations at the July 2024 General Council session but were unable to\nreach consensus.\nIn addition to taking a lead role in the fisheries subsidies negotiations throughout 2024, the United States\nalso pressed for progress to set up the working procedures and reporting templates to enable full\nimplementation of the Agreement upon its entry into force. The United States continued to encourage other\nWTO Members to deposit their instruments of acceptance of the Agreement, and in this second phase of\nnegotiations, urged Members to support adoption of additional disciplines on fisheries subsidies that\ncontribute to overcapacity and overfishing as well as greater transparency with respect to the use of forced\nlabor on fishing vessels. As of December 31, 2024, the second phase of the WTO fisheries subsidies\nnegotiations was ongoing.", "negotiations was ongoing.\nSpecial Session of the Committee on Trade and Development\nAt the MC13 in 2024, the United States actively negotiated the first ever decision on making special and\ndifferential treatment (S&D) more precise, effective, and operational specifically for the Sanitary and\nPhytosanitary (SPS) and the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreements. This decision called for better\ntransparency on decisions by all members to any proposed changes in SPS and TBT requirements, and for\nthe WTO to compile and provide this information to all Members. The decision also called for more\ntargeted training from the WTO for developing members to meet their obligations in these two agreements.\nV.

Only the Ministerial Conference and the", "General Council have the authority to adopt authoritative interpretations of the WTO Agreement, submit\namendments to the WTO Agreement for consideration by Members, and grant waivers of obligations. The\nGeneral Council or the Ministerial Conference must approve the terms for all accessions to the WTO. The\nGeneral Council uses both formal and informal processes to conduct the business of the WTO. Informal\ngroupings, which generally include the United States, play an important role in consensus building.\nIn 2024, the United States participated in all General Council meetings and consultations to advance U.S.\ninterests at the WTO, including the Thirteenth WTO Ministerial Conference (MC13), where Members\nrecognized progress in reforming the WTO, including on dispute settlement and on trade and development.\nPreparation for the Director-General appointment process was initiated earlier than the timeline that the", "General Council had adopted in 2002 under the Procedures for the Appointment of Directors-General.

Committee on Balance-of-Payments Restrictions\nThe Uruguay Round Understanding on Balance-of-Payments clarified General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT) disciplines on balance-of-payments-related trade measures. The Committee on Balance-of-\nPayments Restrictions works closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in conducting\nconsultations on balance of payments issues. Full consultations involve examining a Member\u2019s trade\nrestrictions and balance-of-payments situation, while simplified consultations provide for more general\nreviews. Full consultations are held when restrictive measures are introduced or modified, or at the request\nof a Member in view of improvements in its balance of payments.\nIn 2024, the Committee held two regular meetings, in May and November.

FTAs and CUs are authorized departures from the principle of\nMost-Favored-Nation (MFN) treatment, if relevant requirements are met.\nIn 2024, the CRTA held three formal meetings, in April, July, and November, and two informal meetings\nin September and November. At the formal meetings, the United States urged Members to be more\ntransparent than they have been regarding their regional and bilateral trade agreements and discussed\npotential functional improvements to the committee\u2019s operations.\n6. Accessions to the World Trade Organization", "6. Accessions to the World Trade Organization\nIn January 2024, the Working Parties for the accessions of the Union of the Comoros and Timor-Leste\nconcluded their respective negotiations by approving and recommending the formal adoption by Ministers\nof WTO accession packages for each applicant at the Thirteenth WTO Ministerial Conference. The Union\nof Comoros and Timor-Leste became WTO Members on August 21 and August 30, 2024, respectively.\nAccordingly, the number of applicants for WTO Membership decreased from 24 to 22 in 2024. Of the\nremaining 22 applicants\n1 as of December 31, 2024, five were engaged in the WTO accession process at some point during 2024.\nThe Working Party for the accession of Uzbekistan met twice during the year, and the Working Parties for\nthe accessions of Azerbaijan and Iraq each met once. Uzbekistan made substantial progress in the\nmultilateral rules track and in its bilateral market access negotiations with the United States in 2024. Both", "Ethiopia and Somalia submitted multilateral inputs to the WTO Secretariat in late 2024.\nOf the remaining 17 WTO accession applicants, four (Libya, Sao Tome and Principe, Syria, and\nTurkmenistan) had not submitted the initial documents describing their respective foreign trade regimes as\nof December 31, 2024. As a result, negotiations on their accessions had not begun.

The U.S. objectives are\nto ensure that the applicant fully implements WTO provisions when it becomes a member, to encourage\nmarket-oriented policies in developing and transforming economies, and to use the opportunities provided\nin these negotiations to expand market access for U.S. exports. The United States also has provided\ntechnical assistance to countries seeking accession to the WTO to help them meet the requirements and", "challenges presented, both by the negotiations and the process of implementing WTO provisions in their\ntrade regimes.\nMany current accession applicants, including Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ethiopia, Iraq,\nLebanese Republic, Serbia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have received U.S. technical assistance in their\naccession processes. In 2024, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Republic of Moldova, Timor-Leste, Ukraine, and\nVietnam continued to receive assistance that supports their implementation of their membership\ncommitments.\n7. Working Group on Trade, Debt, and Finance\nMinisters at the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar, in 2001 established the mandate for\nthe Working Group on Trade, Debt, and Finance (WGTDF). Ministers instructed the WGTDF to examine\nthe relationship between trade, debt, and finance and to make recommendations on possible steps, within\nthe mandate and competence of the WTO, to enhance the capacity of the multilateral trading system to", "contribute to a durable solution to the problem of external indebtedness of developing and LDC Members.\nMinisters further instructed the WGTDF to consider possible steps to strengthen the coherence of\ninternational trade and financial policies, with a view to safeguarding the multilateral trading system from\nthe effects of financial and monetary instability.\nThe WGTDF held two formal meetings and one informal meeting in 2024. In these meetings, Members\ndiscussed a suggestion by Pakistan to examine the relationship between trade policies and debt management\nand, separately, to examine specific concerns raised by LDCs and net food-importing developing countries\n(NFIDCs) related to the financing of food imports.

DISPUTE SETTLEMENT UNDERSTANDING\nThe Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (Dispute Settlement\nUnderstanding or DSU), which is annexed to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement, provides\na mechanism to settle disputes under the WTO Agreements.\nThe DSU is administered by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), which consists of representatives of the\nentire membership of the WTO and is empowered to establish dispute settlement panels, adopt panel and\nappellate reports, oversee the implementation of panel recommendations adopted by the DSB, and authorize\ncountermeasures. The DSB makes all of its decisions by consensus unless the DSU provides otherwise.\nThe DSB met 10 times in 2024 to oversee disputes, including through the establishment of new panels, the", "adoption of panel reports, and the surveillance of implementation and recommendations adopted by the\nDSB, and to consider proposed additions to the roster of governmental and nongovernmental panelists.\nDispute Settlement Reform\nThe United States is committed to working towards an improved system that meets the needs of all WTO\nMembers to the greatest extent possible. A functioning dispute settlement system should be transparent,\naccessible, timely, restrained in its interpretations, and focused on resolving a specific dispute between two\nparties. Furthermore, the dispute settlement system should preserve the negotiated space for WTO\nMembers to take the necessary domestic measures and provide confidence that the system equitably serves\nthe interests of all Members.\nIn 2024, the United States actively participated in formal and informal discussions on dispute settlement\nreform open to all WTO Members. The ongoing facilitator-led discussions build upon the interest-based", "discussions initiated by the United States in 2022 that served as an innovative approach to discussions with\nWTO Members of all sizes\u2014including developing country Members\u2014to hear their concerns and solutions\nfor a better system.\nThe United States remains committed to working towards a fundamentally reformed and improved system.\nAppellate Body\nPrior to 2024, the United States made a series of statements at DSB meetings explaining that, for more than\n18 years and across multiple U.S. Administrations, the United States has been raising serious concerns with\n190 | V. THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION\nthe Appellate Body\u2019s disregard for the rules set by WTO Members and adding to or diminishing rights or\nobligations under the WTO Agreement.2 Many WTO Members share these concerns, whether on the\nmandatory 90-day deadline for appeals, review of panel fact-finding, issuing advisory opinions on issues", "not necessary to resolve a dispute, the treatment of Appellate Body reports as precedent, or persons serving\non appeals after their term has ended. The United States has also explained that when the Appellate Body\nabused the authority it had been given within the dispute settlement system, it undermined the legitimacy\nof the system and damaged the interests of all WTO Members who cared about having the agreements\nrespected as they had been negotiated and agreed. A rules-based trading system requires adjudicators to\nfollow the rules as agreed by WTO Members.\nFor many years, the United States and other WTO Members have raised repeated concerns about appellate\nreports going far beyond the text setting out WTO rules in areas as varied as subsidies, antidumping and\ncountervailing duties, regulatory measures and standards under the GATT 1994 and Agreement on\nTechnical Barriers to Trade, and safeguards. Such overreach restricts the ability of the United States to", "regulate in the public interest or protect U.S. workers and businesses against unfair, non-market policies\nand practices.\nAs a result, the United States was not prepared to agree to launch the process to fill vacancies on the WTO\nAppellate Body, thereby allowing the Appellate Body to continue to hear appeals, without WTO Members\nengaging with and addressing these critical issues. Accordingly, there were no persons serving on the\nAppellate Body as of December 31, 2024.\nRoster of Governmental and Non-Governmental Panelists\nArticle 8 of the DSU makes it clear that panelists may be drawn from either the public or private sector and\nmust be \u201cwell-qualified,\u201d such as persons who have served on or presented a case to a panel, represented a\ngovernment in the WTO or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), served with the\nSecretariat, taught or published in the international trade field, or served as a senior trade policy official.", "Since 1985, the Secretariat has maintained a roster of nongovernmental experts for GATT 1947 dispute\nsettlement, which has been available for use by parties in selecting panelists. In 1995, the DSB agreed on\nprocedures for renewing and maintaining the roster, and expanding it to include governmental experts. In\nresponse to a U.S. proposal, the DSB also adopted standards increasing and systematizing the information\nsubmitted by roster candidates. These modifications aid in evaluating candidates\u2019 qualifications and\nencouraging the appointment of well-qualified candidates who have expertise in the subject matters of the\nUruguay Round Agreements. In 2024, the DSB approved by consensus a number of additional names for\nthe roster. The United States scrutinized the credentials of these candidates to assure the quality of the\nroster.\nPursuant to the requirements of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994, the WTO panel roster appears", "in the background information in Annex III. The list in the roster notes the areas of expertise of each roster\nmember (goods, services, or Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights).\nFor further information, see Annex III: Background Information on the WTO.\nRules of Conduct for the Dispute Settlement Understanding\nThe DSB completed work on a code of ethical conduct for WTO dispute settlement and, on December 3,\n1996, adopted the Rules of Conduct for the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the\n2 See, e.g., Minutes of the DSB meeting held on Oct. 26, 2020 (WT/DSB/M/446).\nV.

There were no changes to these Rules in 2024.\nThe Rules of Conduct elaborate on the ethical standards built into the DSU to maintain the integrity,", "impartiality, and confidentiality of proceedings conducted under the DSU. The Rules of Conduct require\nall individuals called upon to participate in dispute settlement proceedings to disclose direct or indirect\nconflicts of interest prior to their involvement in the proceedings and to conduct themselves during their\ninvolvement in the proceedings so as to avoid such conflicts.\nThe Rules of Conduct also provide parties an opportunity to address potential material violations of these\nethical standards. The coverage of the Rules of Conduct exceeds the goals established by the U.S. Congress\nin section 123(c) of the URAA, which directed USTR to seek conflict of interest rules applicable to persons\nserving on panels and members of the Appellate Body. The Rules of Conduct cover not only panelists and\nAppellate Body members, but also: (1) arbitrators; (2) experts participating in the dispute settlement", "mechanism (e.g., the Permanent Group of Experts under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing\nMeasures); (3) members of the WTO Secretariat assisting a panel or assisting in a formal arbitration\nproceeding; and (4) members of the Secretariat supporting the Appellate Body.\nAs noted above, the Rules of Conduct established a disclosure-based system. Examples of the types of\ninformation that covered persons must disclose are set forth in Annex II to the Rules, and include: (1)\nfinancial interests, business interests, and property interests relevant to the dispute in question; (2)\nprofessional interests; (3) other active interests; (4) considered statements of personal opinion on issues\nrelevant to the dispute in question; and (5) employment or family interests.\nDispute Settlement Activity in 2024\nDuring the DSB\u2019s 28 years in operation, WTO Members filed 631 requests for consultations (25 in 1995,", "39 in 1996, 50 in 1997, 41 in 1998, 30 in 1999, 34 in 2000, 23 in 2001, 37 in 2002, 26 in 2003, 19 in 2004,\n12 in 2005, 20 in 2006, 13 in 2007, 19 in 2008, 14 in 2009, 17 in 2010, 8 in 2011, 27 in 2012, 20 in 2013,\n14 in 2014, 13 in 2015, 17 in 2016, 17 in 2017, 39 in 2018, 19 in 2019, 5 in 2020, 9 in 2021, 8 in 2022, 6\nin 2023, and 10 in 2024). During that period, the United States filed 121 complaints against other Members\u2019\nmeasures and received 156 complaints on U.S. measures.

To assist in the selection of panelists, the DSU provides in Article 8.4 that the Secretariat shall maintain", "an indicative list of qualified governmental and non-governmental individuals. Accordingly, the Chairman\nof the DSB proposed at the 10 February meeting that WTO Members review the roster of non-governmental\npanelists established on 30 November 1984 (BISD 31S/9) (hereinafter referred to as the \"1984 GATT\nRoster\") and submit nominations for the indicative list by mid-June 1995. On 14 March, The United States\ndelegation submitted an informal paper discussing, amongst other issues, what information should\naccompany the nomination of individuals, and how names might be removed from the list. The DSB further\ndiscussed the matter in informal consultations on 15 and 24 March, and at the DSB meeting on 29 March.\nThis note puts forward some proposals for the administration of the indicative list, based on the previous\ndiscussions in the DSB.\nGeneral DSU requirements\n2. The DSU requires that the indicative list initially include \u201cthe roster of governmental and non-", "2. The DSU requires that the indicative list initially include \u201cthe roster of governmental and non-\ngovernmental panelists established on 30 November 1984 (BISD 31S/9) and other rosters and indicative\nlists established under any of the covered agreements, and shall retain names of persons on those rosters\nand indicative lists at the time of entry into force of the WTO Agreement\u201d (DSU 8.4). Additions to the\nindicative list are to be made by Members who may \u201cperiodically suggest names of governmental and non-\ngovernmental individuals for inclusion on the indicative list, providing relevant information on their\nknowledge of international trade and of the sectors or subject matter of the covered agreements\u201d. The names\n\u201cshall be added to the list upon approval by the DSB\u201d (DSU 8.4).\nSubmission of information\n3. As a minimum, the information to be submitted regarding each nomination should clearly reflect the", "requirements of the DSU. These provide that the list \u201cshall indicate specific areas of experience or expertise\nof the individuals in the sectors or subject matter of the covered agreements\u201d (DSU 8.4). The DSU also\nrequires that panelists be \u201cwell-qualified governmental and/or non-governmental individuals, including\npersons who have served on or presented a case to a panel, served as a representative of a Member or of a\ncontracting party to GATT 1947 or as a representative to the Council or Committee of any covered\nagreement or its predecessor agreement, or in the Secretariat, taught or published on international trade law\nor policy, or served as a senior trade policy official of a Member\u201d (DSU 8.1).\n4. The basic information required for the indicative list could best be collected by use of a standardized\nform. Such a form, which could be called a Summary Curriculum Vitae, would be filled out by all nominees", "to ensure that relevant information is obtained. This would also permit information on the indicative list to\nbe stored in an electronic database, making the list easily updateable and readily available to Members and\nthe Secretariat. As well as supplying a completed Summary Curriculum Vitae form, persons proposed for\ninclusion on the indicative list could also, if they wished, supply a full Curriculum Vitae. This would not,\nhowever, be entered into the electronic part of the database.\nUpdating of indicative list\n5. The DSU does not specifically provide for the regular updating of the indicative list. In order to maintain\nthe credibility of the list, it should however be completely updated every two years. Within the first month\nof each two-year period, Members would forward updated Curricula Vitae of persons appearing on the\nindicative list. At any time, Members would be free to modify the indicative list by proposing new names", "for inclusion, or specifically requesting removal of names of persons proposed by the Member who were\nno longer in a position to serve, or by updating the summary Curriculum Vitae.\n6. Names on the 1984 GATT Roster that are not specifically resubmitted, together with up-to-date summary\nCurriculum Vitae, by a Member before 31 July 1995 would not appear after that date on the indicative list.\nOther rosters\n7. The Decision on Certain Dispute Settlement Procedures for the GATS (S/L/2 of 4 April 1995), adopted\nby the Council for Trade in Services on 1 March 1995, provides for a special roster of panelists with sectoral\nexpertise. It states that \u201cpanels for disputes regarding sectoral matters shall have the necessary expertise\nrelevant to the specific services sectors which the dispute concerns\u201d. It directs the Secretariat to maintain\nthe roster and \u201cdevelop procedures for its administration in consultation with the Chairman of the Council\u201d.", "A working document (S/C/W/1 of 15 February 1995) noted by the Council for Trade in Services states that\n\u201cthe roster to be established under the GATS pursuant to this Decision would form part of the indicative\nlist referred to in the DSU\u201d. The specialized roster of panelists under the GATS should therefore be\nintegrated into the indicative list, taking care that the latter provides for a mention of any service sectoral\nexpertise of persons on the list.\n8. A suggested format for the Summary Curriculum Vitae form for the purposes of maintaining the\nIndicative List is attached.\n_______________\nSUMMARY CURRICULUM VITAE\nFOR PERSONS PROPOSED FOR THE INDICATIVE LIST1\n1.
